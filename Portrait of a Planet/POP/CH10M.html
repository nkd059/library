                        office workers tapped at their computers, unaware that their surroundings were about to change forever. This coast lies near the convergent boundary at which the Pacific Plate slips beneath the edge of Japan and sinks back into
                        the mantle. Averaged over time, the relative movement across this boundary takes place at a rate of about 8 cm/y. But the motion doesn‚Äôt take place smoothly. Rather, for a while, rocks adjacent to the boundary quietly flex, like
                        a stick bent between your hands, to accommodate the motion, until suddenly, like a stick that snaps after you bend it too far, the rocks break, and a large amount of slip on a fracture takes place in a matter of seconds to minutes
                        <strong>(Fig. 10.1)</strong>. On March 11, at 2:46 P.M., such a ‚Äúsnap‚Äù started about 130 km east of Japan‚Äôs coast, at a depth of about 24 km below the seafloor. Japan lurched eastward by several meters, relative to the Pacific
                        Plate, and the seafloor moved upward by about 30 cm. The stage had been set for a disaster.</p>

                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-800d-b4d6-ea9af7b11775" class="">Geologists refer to a fracture on which such sliding takes place as a fault. The fault involved in the March 11 event delineates the boundary between Honshu and the Pacific Plate. The sudden breaking and sliding of rock along a fault
                        produces energy that propagates through the crust in the form of vibrations. In essence, these vibrations resemble the shock waves that travel through a breaking stick to your hands. In the Earth, vibrations can race through the
                        crust at an average speed of 11,000 km/h, 10 times the speed of sound in air. When the vibrations produced on March 11 reached Japan, the land surface lurched back and forth and bounced up and down for over a minute. People panicked,
                        became disoriented, and even seasick‚Äîsome lost their balance and crouched or fell, and some heard a dull rumbling or thumping. Bottles and plates flew off shelves and crashed to the floor, buildings twisted and swayed, ceilings
                        and facades fell in a shower of debris, dust rose from the ground to create a fog-like mist, power lines stretched and sparked, and weaker buildings collapsed <strong>(Fig. 10.2a)</strong>. In addition, several natural gas tanks
                        and pipes broke, sending flammable vapors into the air‚Äîin some places, the gas ignited in billows of flame that set fire to damaged buildings. A major earthquake‚Äîan episode of ground shaking‚Äîhad occurred. Geologists now refer to
                        this event as the T≈çhoku earthquake, named for the northern province of Honshu.</p>

                        triggered by the May 12, 2008, earthquake in Sichuan, in central China, leveled cities‚Äî70,000 people died, and millions were left homeless. But in Japan, a country struck by earthquakes fairly frequently, officials have established
                        stringent building codes, which successfully prevented widespread building collapse in 2011. Unfortunately, even strong buildings could not resist what happened minutes after the earthquake shock. The sudden displacement of the
                        seafloor off Japan‚Äôs coast displaced a massive amount of ocean water and produced immense water waves known as <em>tsunamis</em>. When these waves washed over the land, they became a roaring jumble of water and debris that submerged
                        low-lying areas as far as 10 km from the shoreline <strong>(Fig. 10.2b, c)</strong>. In the end, the immensity of the devastation due to the T≈çhoku earthquake was almost beyond comprehension.</p>

                    class="">Earthquakes are a fact of life on planet Earth‚Äîalmost 1 million detectable earthquakes happen every year. Most are a consequence of plate movement‚Äîthey punctuate each step in the growth of mountains, the drift of continents, and the
                        opening and closing of ocean basins. Fortunately, most cause no damage or casualties, either because they are too small or because they occur in unpopulated areas. But a few hundred earthquakes per year rattle the ground sufficiently
                        to crack or topple buildings and injure their occupants, and every 5 to 20 years, on average, a great earthquake triggers a horrific calamity. In fact, during the past two millennia, ground shaking, tsunamis, landslides, fires,
                        and other phenomena caused by earthquakes have killed over 3.5 million people <strong>(Table 10.1)</strong>.</p>

First, we define the point on a fault at which rock starts to rupture and slip as the <em>hypocenter</em>, or focus, of an earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.3a)</strong>.
                        Simplistically, we can picture the focus as the place inside the Earth from which earthquake energy, in the form of vibrations, begins to propagate. (In reality, the area of a fault that slips during an earthquake extends beyond
                        the focus, so not all of the energy produced during an earthquake actually originates right at the focus.) Second, we define the point on the surface of the Earth that lies directly above the focus as the earthquake‚Äôs epicenter.
                        We can portray the position of an epicenter as a spot on a map <strong>(Fig. 10.3b)</strong>.</p>

But on closer examination, you may be able to see evidence of the sliding that occurred on a fault. For example,
                        the rock adjacent to the fault may be broken up into angular fragments, or may be pulverized into tiny grains, due to the crushing and grinding that can accompany slip. The surface of a fault may be polished and grooved as if scratched
                        by a rasp. In some localities, a fault cuts through a <em>marker</em>, such as a distinct sedimentary bed, an igneous dike, or a fence. Where this happens, the marker on one side of the fault no longer lies adjacent to the marker
                        on the other side after the fault slips. The distance between two ends of the marker, as measured along the fault surface in the direction of slip, is the fault‚Äôs displacement <strong>(Fig. 10.4)</strong>.</p>

                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80d6-9d7f-fc866ae72375" class="">In the 19th century, miners who encountered faults in mine tunnels referred to the rock mass above a sloping fault plane as the <em>hanging wall</em>, because it hung over their heads, and the rock mass below the fault plane as the
                        <em>footwall</em>, because it lay beneath their feet. These miners described the direction in which rock masses slipped on a sloping fault by specifying the direction in which the hanging wall moved relative to the footwall, and
                        we still use their terminology today (<strong>Geology at a Glance</strong>, pp. 338‚Äì339). Specifically, a fault whose hanging wall has slipped down the slope of the fault is a <em>normal fault</em>, and a fault whose hanging wall
                        has slipped up the slope is a <em>reverse fault</em> (if steep) or a <em>thrust fault</em> (if shallowly sloping). A <em>strike-slip fault</em> is a near-vertical fracture on which slip moves rock parallel to an imaginary horizontal
                        line, called a <em>strike line</em>, on the fault plane. No upward or downward motion takes place on a strike-slip fault. Note that although we depict faults as single surfaces in Figure 10.5, in reality, major faults commonly
                        consist of a zone including several smaller faults.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80eb-9f6a-eb9da6ad8e82" class="">The direction of slip on a fault reflects the nature of crustal movements causing the fault. For example, normal faults form in response to stretching or extension of the crust, whereas reverse faults and thrust faults develop in response
                        to squeezing (compression) and shortening of the crust. Strike-slip faults form where one block of crust slides past another laterally.</p>

Faults that have slipped recently or are likely to slip in the near future are called <em>active faults</em> (and if they
                        generate earthquakes, news media sometimes refer to them as ‚Äúearthquake faults‚Äù). Most active faults occur along plate boundaries or in currently developing collision zones and rifts. Faults that last slipped in the distant past
                        and probably won‚Äôt move again for at least millennia are called <em>inactive faults</em>. Some faults have been inactive for billions of years and probably will never slip again.</p>

Apply an upward push on one of the clamps and a downward push on the other. By doing so, you have applied a stress to the rock‚Äîsimplistically, we can think
                        of stress as a push, pull, or shear. At first, the rock bends slightly but doesn‚Äôt break <strong>(Fig. 10.6a)</strong>. In fact, if you were to stop applying stress before the rock broke, the rock would return to its original shape.
                        Geologists refer to such a phenomenon as elastic behavior‚Äîthe same phenomenon happens when you stretch a spring and then let go. The change in shape due to elastic bending, stretching, or shortening is called <em>elastic strain</em>.

                        has become a fault. Any elastic strain that had built up in the rock gets released, so the rock straightens out, or rebounds <strong>(Fig. 10.6c)</strong>. Such fault formation in a previously intact rock releases energy and generates

                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-807a-b6ab-f3d17b00164b" class="">We‚Äôve just seen how earthquakes can happen when intact rock ruptures. Earthquakes can also happen by the sudden reactivation of sliding on pre-existing faults. In this case, stress builds up in rock until it‚Äôs sufficient to overcome
                            friction, either by breaking off asperities or by causing them to plow a groove into the opposing fault surface. The breaking or plowing of asperities causes the release of energy and, like the fracture of intact rock, produces
                            earthquakes. And, like a new fault, a <em>reactivated fault</em> can‚Äôt slip forever. Friction stops the motion and prevents the fault from slipping until stress builds up sufficiently again. Geologists refer to such alternation
                            between stress buildup and slip events as stick-slip behavior. You can model stick-slip behavior with a simple experiment. Attach a spring to a heavy block sitting on a rough table. By pulling on the spring, you elastically
                            stretch it and apply a stress to the block. The more you stretch the spring, the greater the stress. Suddenly the block slips, and when this happens, the spring relaxes, so the stress decreases. You have to pull on the spring
                            once again to increase stress enough to cause another sliding event <strong>(Fig. 10.7c)</strong>.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-802e-874b-ca2cbb70dfd8" class="">In sum, we see that earthquakes happen because stresses build up, causing rock adjacent to the fault to develop elastic strain until either intact rock breaks or a pre-existing fault reactivates. When slip takes place, the once-bent
                            rocks adjacent to the fault rebound back to their original, unbent shape, thereby relieving the elastic strain. Geologists refer to this overall concept as the elastic-rebound theory of earthquake generation. Notably, the stress
                            necessary to reactivate a fault tends to be less than the stress necessary to break intact rock, so most earthquakes probably represent slip on pre-existing faults.</p>

These shocks possibly result from the development of the smaller cracks in the vicinity of
                            what will become the major fault surface. Smaller earthquakes, called aftershocks, follow a mainshock‚Äîthe largest of these are 10 times smaller than the mainshock, and most are much smaller. Most aftershocks, especially larger
                            ones, take place soon after the mainshock. But they can occur sporadically for weeks or even years. Their distribution defines the overall area of the fault that slipped during the mainshock. Aftershocks of the T≈çhoku earthquake
                            indicate that the fault slipped over an area 600 km long, as measured parallel to the coast, by 200 km wide, as measured perpendicular to the coast <strong>(Fig. 10.8)</strong>. Aftershocks happen because slip during the mainshock
                            does not leave the fault in a perfectly stable configuration. For example, after the mainshock, protrusions on one side of the fault surface, in their new position, may push into the opposing side and generate new stresses.
                            Such stresses may become large enough either to cause a small portion of the fault around the protrusion to slip again, or to trigger slip on a nearby fault.</p>

                            mantle. In fact, such faults may be hundreds to thousands of kilometers long as measured on a map. For example, the San Andreas fault, a transform boundary, extends from the Earth‚Äôs surface to the base of the lithosphere and

The smallest perceptible earthquakes

                            1 cm of displacement per year, on average, the fault‚Äôs movement will yield 10 km of displacement after 1 million years. Thus, earthquakes mark the incremental movements that create mountains.</p>

In contrast, when a material changes shape by flowing slowly, while remaining solid, we say that it has undergone
                            <em>plastic deformation</em>. To picture the contrast between these two types of behavior, consider what happens if you try to bend a wax candle that has been kept in a freezer, compared with what happens if you try to bend
                            a candle that has been softened (but not melted) by placing it in a slightly warm oven. The frozen candle snaps, whereas the softened candle bends. Generation of energy in most earthquakes involves brittle deformation of rock,
                            for if rock flows plastically, it can accommodate movements without causing earthquakes.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8044-8e03-eff2043d62c9" class="">Rock, like wax, tends to be more brittle at cooler temperatures and more plastic at warmer temperatures. Because the temperature of continental crust increases with depth, continental crustal rocks typically become plastic at depths
                            below 15‚Äì20 km. As a result, earthquakes on faults in continental crust occur mostly in the upper 15‚Äì20 km. If a fault extends below that depth, slip on that fault still takes place, but the movement occurs plastically without
                            generating earthquakes. In crust (or lithospheric mantle) that has been subducted, earthquakes can happen at much deeper positions because cooler rock can be carried down to greater depth, as we‚Äôll see later in this chapter.</p>

                                is the point on the surface of the Earth directly above the focus. Faults display stick-slip behavior in that stress builds until slip takes place. Then, stress builds again. Elastic rebound of rock when slip takes place
                                generates earthquake energy. The sizes of faults and the amount of displacement during faulting vary greatly.</p>

As we‚Äôve noted, earthquake energy moves through rock and sediment in the form of vibrations. We call these
                        movements seismic waves, or <em>earthquake waves</em>. You feel such waves when you hold one end of a brick and strike the other end with a hammer.</p>

Body waves pass through the interior of the Earth, whereas surface waves travel along the Earth‚Äôs surface. Waves that cause
                        particles of material to move back and forth parallel to the direction in which the wave itself moves are called compressional waves. As a compressional wave passes, the material first compresses (or squeezes together) and then
                        dilates (or expands). To see this kind of motion in action, push on the end of a spring and watch as the little pulse, in which the coils become more closely spaced, moves along the length of the spring. Waves that cause particles
                        of material to move back and forth perpendicular to the direction in which the wave itself moves are called shear waves. To see shear-wave motion, jerk the end of a rope up and down and watch how the undulation travels along the

A seismograph consists of two components: an instrument, called a
                            <em>seismo-meter</em>, that detects shaking, and a device that records the data produced by the seismometer over time. Seismologists use two basic configurations of seismographs, one for measuring vertical (up-and-down) ground
                            motion and the other for measuring horizontal (back-and-forth) ground motion.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8084-a761-d7dc828611ab" class="">A traditional, mechanical vertical-motion seismograph consists of a heavy weight (like a pendulum) suspended from a spring <strong>(Fig. 10.11a)</strong>. The spring connects to a sturdy frame that has been bolted to the ground.
                            A pen extends sideways from the weight and touches a vertical revolving cylinder of paper (the recording device) that has been connected to the seismometer frame. If the ground is steady, the pen traces out a straight reference
                            line as the cylinder revolves. But when a seismic wave arrives and causes the ground surface to move up and down, it makes the seismometer frame and the attached paper cylinder move up and down as well. The weight, however,
                            because of its <em>inertia</em> (the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest), remains fixed in space. As the revolving paper roll moves up and down with respect to the fixed pen, the line traced by the pen on the paper

At first glance, a typical seismogram looks like a messy squiggle of lines, but to a seismologist it contains
                            a wealth of information. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents the <em>amplitude</em> (the size) of the seismic waves. The instant at which a seismic wave appears at a seismograph station defines
                            the <em>arrival time</em> of the wave. The first squiggles on the record represent P-waves because P-waves travel the fastest. Next come the S-waves, and finally the surface waves (R-waves and L-waves). Typically, the surface
                            waves have the largest amplitude and arrive over a relatively long interval of time.</p>

This way, all seismograms use
                            exactly the same time scale, so it‚Äôs possible to compare seismograms from different parts of the world and look for variations in arrival time and amplitude, quantities that depend on the distance between the seismograph station
                            and the epicenter, and on the size of the earthquake. Today, seismologists can obtain data from thousands of stations constituting the <em>worldwide seismic network</em>. Governments have supported this network because in addition
                            to recording natural earthquakes, it can also detect nuclear-bomb tests, so seismic records can allow governments to verify compliance with nuclear test-ban treaties.</p>

                                than S-waves, the travel-time curve for an S-wave differs from that for a P-wave. The gap between the two curves (as measured along a vertical line) represents the time delay between the P-wave arrival and the S-wave arrival.</p>

                                move it back and forth until one end lies on the P-wave curve and the other end lies on the S-wave curve (this gives the S ‚Äì P time). You have now identified the gap between the two travel-time curves for your seismograph

To determine the map position of
                                    the epicenter, we <em>triangulate</em>, meaning we plot the distance from the epicenter to three stations. For example, imagine that you determine that the epicenter lies 2,000 km from Station 1, 4,000 km from Station
                                    2, and 6,000 km from Station 3. On a map, you can draw a circle around each station such that the radius of the circle represents the distance between the station and the epicenter, at the scale of the map. The epicenter
                                    lies at the intersection of the three circles, for this is the only point at which the epicenter has the appropriate measured distance from all three stations <strong>(Fig. 10.14c)</strong>.</p>

Seismologists have developed two scales to define ‚Äúsize‚Äù in a meaningful way so that they can systematically
                        describe and compare earthquakes. The first scale, called the Mercalli Intensity Scale, depends on human perception of ground shaking and the damage resulting from it at a given locality. The second scale, called the magnitude
                        scale, focuses on the measured amount of ground motion, as recorded by a seismograph at a specificed distance from the epicenter.</p>
                    <h2 id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80ba-98e5-fe3aa06f4bcd" class="">Mercalli Intensity Scale</h2>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-807f-9ea2-fba73f2b880a" class="">The intensity of a given earthquake refers to the effect or consequence of its ground shaking at a locality on the Earth‚Äôs surface. In 1902, an Italian scientist named Giuseppe Mercalli devised a scale for defining intensity by systematically
                        assessing human perception of shaking and of the damage that an earthquake caused. A version of this scale, called the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, continues to be used today <strong>(Table 10.2)</strong>. The MMI scale
                        uses roman numerals ranging from I (low intensity) to XII (extremely high intensity). To use the scale, seismologists visit the affected region to interview residents and observe the damage. For example, if an earthquake at a location
                        causes everyone to notice shaking but does not damage buildings, then the earthquake had an intensity of III at that location. In contrast, if ground shaking feels significant and destroys poorly constructed buildings, but causes
                        only minor damage to substantial buildings, then the earthquake had an intensity of VIII.</p>

Furthermore, the MMI number varies with location for a particular seismic
                        event‚Äîwe cannot assign a single MMI number to a given earthquake. Typically, the intensity decreases progressively away from the epicenter. To illustrate how intensity varies over a region for a particular earthquake, seismologists
                        draw lines, called contours, which delimit zones where the earthquake had a given intensity (<strong>Fig. 10.15</strong>). Generally, seismologists refer to the area within the intensity II contour line as the <em>felt area</em>.
                        Of note, not only is the maximum intensity of a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù earthquake greater than that of a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù one, but the distance from the epicenter to a given contour tends to be greater for a larger earthquake than for a smaller one. In
                        detail, the spacing between intensity contours for a given earthquake depends on the strength of the crust in the region where the earthquake occurred. In regions underlain by strong crust, the crust can transmit earthquake energy
                        more efficiently, so the contours lie father apart. In contrast, in regions underlain by weak crust (where the crust contains lots of fractures and/or consists of soft rock), the contours lie closer together, so the earthquake
                        affects a smaller area.</p>

                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-801a-bf48-c8abc200c2e4" class="">When you read a report of an earthquake disaster in the news, you will probably come across a phrase that states something like this: ‚ÄúAn earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck the city yesterday at noon.‚Äù What does this mean? The
                        magnitude of an earthquake indicates the maximum amplitude of ground motion recorded by a seismograph at a specific, standard distance from the focus. By ‚Äúamplitude of ground motion,‚Äù we mean the amount of up-and-down or back-and-forth
                        motion of the ground. The larger the ground motion, the greater the deflection of a seismometer pen tracing out a seismogram. Because the magnitude does not depend on distance, use of the magnitude scale allows seismologists to
                        define the size of an earthquake objectively.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80b9-bb62-ca1bc2b1c13a" class="">An American seismologist, Charles Richter, developed a method for defining and measuring earthquake magnitude. The scale he proposed, in 1935, came to be known as the Richter scale. It indicates the maximum amplitude of motion as it
                        would be recorded at a seismograph station 100 km from the epicenter. Because the amount of deflection on a seismogram depends on the distance between the seismograph and the epicenter, and since most seismograph stations do not
                        happen to lie exactly 100 km from the epicenter, seismologists use a chart to adjust for distance of the station from the epicenter when calculating magnitude <strong>(Fig. 10.16)</strong>.</p>

                    class="">Richter‚Äôs scale became so widely used that news reports often include such wording as ‚ÄúThe earthquake registered a 7.2 on the Richter scale.‚Äù These days, however, seismologists actually use several different magnitude scales, not just
                        the Richter scale, because the original Richter scale works well only for earthquakes whose focus lies close to the Earth‚Äôs surface and whose epicenter lies fairly close to the seismograph station. Because of the distance limitation,
                        seismologists now refer to a number on the original Richter scale as a <em>local magnitude</em> (<em>M</em>L).</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80bf-9353-f0925642f6cb" class="">The Richter scale cannot accurately define the sizes of extremely large earthquakes, because for an earthquake above a given size, the scale gives roughly the same magnitude regardless of how large the earthquake vibrations actually
                        are. Because of this problem, seismologists developed the moment magnitude scale (<em>M</em>W), which provides the most accurate representation of an earthquake‚Äôs size. To calculate the moment magnitude, seismologists take into
                        account the amplitude of several different seismic waves, the dimensions of the slipped area on the fault, and the amount of displacement that occurred. The largest recorded earthquake in history, the great 1960 Chilean quake,
                        registered as an 8.5 on the <em>M</em>L scale, but as a 9.5 on the <em>M</em>W scale. The larger number makes more sense because this earthquake was indeed much larger than other known events for which <em>M</em>L = 8.5. Of note,
                        the catastrophic 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake had a magnitude of <em>M</em>W = 9.0.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80c5-a6d6-d044e590ca85" class="">What magnitude do modern news reports of earthquakes provide? For early reports, seismologists report a preliminary magnitude, typically an <em>M</em>L, which can be calculated quickly. Later on, after they have had the chance to collect
                        the necessary data, seismologists report an <em>M</em>W, which becomes the number that appears in archival records.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8014-8fd7-f102c8ee05bb" class="">All magnitude scales are logarithmic, meaning that an increase of one integer of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the maximum ground motion. Therefore, an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake results in ground motion that is 10 times
                        greater than that of an <em>M</em>W 7 earthquake, and 1,000 times greater than that of an <em>M</em>W 5 earthquake. To make discussion easier, seismologists use familiar adjectives to describe the size of an earthquake, as listed
                        in <strong>Table 10.3</strong>. Note that we can roughly correlate magnitude with the intensity at the epicenter for earthquakes that take place in the upper continental crust.</p>

Seismologists have compared the energy released by earthquakes with that released by other events. According to some estimates, an <em>M</em>W 5.3 earthquake releases about as much
                        energy as the Hiroshima atomic bomb, and an <em>M</em>W 9 earthquake releases significantly more energy than the largest hydrogen bomb ever detonated, and even more than the explosive eruption of Krakatau (see Box 9.1). Notably,
                        an increase in magnitude by one integer represents approximately a 32-fold increase in energy. Therefore, an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake releases about 1 million times more energy than an <em>M</em>W 4 earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.17a)</strong>.
                        In fact, a single <em>M</em>W 8.9 earthquake releases as much energy as the entire average global annual release of seismic energy coming from all other earthquakes combined! Fortunately, such large earthquakes occur much less
                        frequently than small earthquakes. About 100,000 <em>M</em>W 3 earthquakes happen every year, but an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake happens only about once or twice a year <strong>(Fig. 10.17b)</strong>.</p>

                        Most seismic belts coincide with plate boundaries, so we can refer to earthquakes within these belts as <em>plate-boundary earthquakes</em>. Earthquakes that happen away from plate boundaries are called <em>intraplate earthquakes</em>;

                            ridges have foci at depths of less than 25 km, so we classify them as shallow earthquakes. Since most ridges lie out in the ocean, far away from settled areas, mid-ocean ridge earthquakes don‚Äôt cause damage. Only a few populated

                            large buildings. But it was built on the transform boundary along which the Pacific Plate moves north at an average rate of 6 cm/y relative to North America. Because of the stick-slip behavior of the fault, this movement tends
                            to happen in sudden jerks, each of which causes an earthquake. At 5:12 A.M. on April 18, the fault near San Francisco slipped by as much as 7 m, and minutes later seismic waves struck the city. Witnesses watched in horror as
                            the streets undulated, buildings swayed and banged together, laundry lines stretched and snapped, and weaker buildings collapsed. Fire followed soon after, consuming huge areas of the city <strong>(Fig. 10.20b)</strong>. Judging
                            from the damage, seismologists estimate that the earthquake had an <em>M</em>W of 7.9.</p>

Specifically,

                            disastrous, shallow earthquakes. Thrust faults in the accretionary prism may also slip. Bending causes normal faults to develop in the downgoing plate, seaward of the trench. In some cases, shear between the downgoing plate

                            large tsunamis. In each case, an area a few hundred kilometers wide (as measured perpendicular to the trench) and several hundred to 1,200 km long (as measured parallel to the trench) slipped. All convergent boundaries have

Shouldn‚Äôt the rock of a subducted plate at these depths be too warm and soft to break brittlely? To answer these questions, seismologists have studied the
                            rate at which a subducting slab warms up as it sinks down through hot asthenosphere. They determined that because rock serves as an insulator, the interior of a downgoing plate actually remains cool enough to fracture seismically
                            down to a depth of about 300 km. To explain deeper earthquakes, seismologists have studied the stability of minerals in the lithosphere. They found that at the extreme pressures developed in deeply subducted lithosphere, certain
                            minerals (such as olivine) collapse to form new, denser minerals (spinel, at a depth of 410 km, and perovskite, at a depth of 660 km; see Fig. 10.21a). As such sudden phase changes (see Chapter 8) take place, the minerals abruptly
                            decrease in volume, perhaps along a fault-like band. This process could generate an earthquake, but the exact process by which this occurs remains the subject of research. Some of a subducted plate may accumulate at 660 km,
                            whereas some sinks still deeper. But at depths greater than 660 km, processes that generate earthquakes in a subducted plate can no longer take place.</p>

                            Washington, where the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath North America). An earthquake of similar size today would be disastrous to the region. GPS measurements have detected movement of the crust of the region, indicating

                            that the region is not immune to seismicity. The tremor was felt from the Carolinas to New England, and people evacuated buildings in Washington, D.C., where some damage occurred to the Washington Monument and other structures.</p>

But the timing of some earthquakes relative to human-caused events suggests that in certain cases, people can indeed influence seismicity. Induced seismicity,
                                meaning seismic activity caused by actions of people, generally occurs in response to changes in groundwater pressure. Simplistically, the pressure of groundwater can push apart the opposing surfaces of faults slightly
                                and, by doing so, effectively decrease the friction that resists slip on those faults. So when people increase groundwater pressure by pumping lots of water underground in a region containing an active fault, the fault
                                may slip under regional stress conditions that might not have otherwise led to slip. Seismologists observed such a relationship near Denver, Colorado, when engineers pumped wastewater from a military installation down a
                                deep well‚Äîas soon as the pumping began, small earthquakes started in the region. A similar phenomenon has happened in Oklahoma, where seismicity increased markedly after 2009. The observed ‚Äúearthquake swarm‚Äù lies near high-volume
                                disposal wells into which wastewater coming from oil and gas wells has been injected (see Chapter 14).</p>

Faulting generally breaks up rock, making it more erodible by rivers, so it‚Äôs no surprise
                                that deep river valleys form over large faults. When a reservoir fills the valley above a fault, water seeps down into the fault and, under the pressure caused by the water column above, might trigger earthquakes.</p>

It didn‚Äôt take long
                        for seismic waves from the <em>M</em>W 8.5‚Äì9.0 earthquake to reach Lisbon, 440 km to the northeast. Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, was one of the great port cities and cultural centers of the day. The resulting ground shaking
                        toppled 85% of the city‚Äôs buildings, and fires set by overturned stoves then consumed much of the wreckage. Forty minutes later, a tsunami inundated the coast and washed away Lisbon‚Äôs harbor. In the end, more than 50,000 people
                        lost their lives. Also, the library, which housed all the records of Portuguese exploration as well as countless Renaissance artworks, was destroyed. The event led philosophers such as Voltaire (1694‚Äì1778) to question the long-held
                        belief that ‚Äúthis was the best of all possible worlds,‚Äù and to suggest that bad things happen by chance, so that making a better world requires human effort. This concept set the stage for the Age of Enlightenment.</p>

Its duration depends both on how long it took for slip on the earthquake-generating fault to take
                        place, and on the distance between the focus and the surface location. The distance to the focus matters because different types of seismic waves travel at different velocities, so the difference between their arrival times increases
                        as distance increases.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-804d-9199-dc1c94635a0a" class="">The intensity of an earthquake at a given location depends on four factors: (1) the magnitude of the earthquake, because larger-magnitude events release more energy; (2) the distance from the focus, because vibrations lose their energy
                        as they pass through the Earth; (3) the nature of the substrate at the location (i.e., the character and thickness of materials beneath the ground surface), because earthquake waves tend to be amplified in weaker substrates; and
                        (4) the frequency of the earthquake waves (where <em>frequency</em> equals the number of oscillations that pass a point in a specified interval of time)‚Äîhigh-frequency vibrations are not as dangerous as low-frequency vibrations
                        because the former don‚Äôt cause buildings to sway as much.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80f7-aa91-de113d42ac13" class="">Different kinds of earthquake waves cause different kinds of ground motion <strong>(Fig. 10.26)</strong>. For example, P-waves are almost perpendicular to the ground surface when they arrive and cause the ground to buck up and down.
                        S-waves also reach the surface at a steep angle, but these waves are more complicated and tend to cause back-and-forth motion parallel to the ground surface. L-waves, the first surface waves to arrive, cause a snake-like side-to-side
                        undulation. R-waves, the last waves to arrive, result in a rolling motion as particles near the surface of the ground follow elliptical paths, in cross section. Interference among the different kinds of waves causes motion to be
                        anything but regular. In great earthquakes, the ground‚Äôs movement can have an amplitude of as much as 1 m at the epicenter, but in moderate earthquakes, motions fall in the range of a few centimeters or less. Ground accelerations
                        caused by moderate earthquakes lie in the range of 10%‚Äì20% of <em>g</em> (where <em>g</em> represents the acceleration due to gravity), and during a great earthquake, accelerations may approach 1 <em>g,</em> so ground movements
                        can toss you into the air.</p>

                        back and forth, or lurch up and down, depending on the type of wave motion. As a result, connectors between the frame and facade of a building may separate, so that the facade crashes to the ground. The flexing of walls shatters
                        windows and wallboard and makes roofs collapse. Building floors or bridge decks may shift sideways and tip support columns over, or rise up and slam down on the support columns, thereby crushing them. Some buildings collapse with
                        their floors piled on top of one another like pancakes in a stack, whereas others simply tip over.</p>

One of the biggest known examples happened in 1958, when an <em>M</em>W 8.3 earthquake in southeastern Alaska
                        triggered a landslide at the head of Lituya Bay. The splash from the displaced water washed the forest off the opposite wall of the bay up to an elevation of 516 m‚Äîthis wall of water was 25% higher than the Empire State Building

A portion of the city had been built on land underlain by wet sand. During the ground shaking, the foundations of over 15,000 buildings sank into their substrate, causing
                        walls and roofs to crack. Several four-story buildings in a newly built apartment complex tipped over <strong>(Fig. 10.29a)</strong>. In 2011, an earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, not only caused sturdy stone buildings to
                        crumble, but also caused sand to erupt and produce small, cone-shaped mounds, called <em>sand volcanoes</em> or <em>sand blows,</em> on the ground surface <strong>(Fig. 10.29b)</strong>. The transfer of sand from underground to
                        the surface led to the formation of depressions large enough to swallow cars <strong>(Fig. 10.29c)</strong>.</p>

Liquefaction in beds of wet sand or silt happens because ground shaking causes the sediment grains to try to settle together. But because water fills the spaces (pores) between
                        grains, water pressure in the pores increases and pushes the grains apart, and the wet silt or sand becomes a slurry called <em>quicksand</em>. As the material above the liquefied sediment settles downward, pressure squeezes the
                        sand upward and out onto the ground surface‚Äîthe result being sand volcanoes, as we‚Äôve seen. The settling of sedimentary layers down into a liquefied layer can also disrupt bedding and can lead to formation of open fissures of the
                        land surface <strong>(Fig. 10.29d, e)</strong>.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8048-9ecd-f221a7e6e41f" class="">The 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska caused liquefaction beneath the Turnagain Heights neighborhood of Anchorage. Contractors had built the neighborhood on a small terrace of uplifted sediment. A 20-m-high escarpment that dropped
                        down to Cook Inlet, a bay of the Pacific Ocean, formed the edge of the terrace. Here, as the ground shaking began, a layer of wet clay beneath the neighborhood liquefied. In this case, liquefaction allowed the overlying terrace,
                        along with the houses built on top of it, to slide seaward. In the process, the terrace broke into separate blocks that tilted, turning the landscape into a chaotic jumble <strong>(Fig. 10.30)</strong>. In wet clay, the clay flakes
                        stick together because there is surface tension in the water between the flakes, caused by the attraction of the water molecules to one another. When still, wet clay can behave like a solid gel, but when shaken, the weak bonds
                        between water molecules break, and the clay transforms into a viscous liquid. Clay that displays this behavior is called thixotropic clay, or <em>quick clay</em>.</p>

Most of the destruction caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake resulted from fire. For 3 days, the blaze spread through the city until firefighters
                        contained it by blowing up buildings to form a firebreak. By then, 500 blocks of structures had turned to ash, causing 20 times as much financial loss as the shaking itself. When a large earthquake hit Tokyo in September 1923,
                        fires set by cooking stoves spread quickly through the wood-and-paper buildings, creating an inferno that heated the air above the city. The hot air rose like a balloon, and when cool air rushed in, wind gusts of over 100 mph stoked
                        the blaze, which grew to engulf 120,000 people <strong>(Fig. 10.31b)</strong>.</p>

Along this convergent boundary, the Indian Ocean floor subducts at
                        a rate of about 4 cm per year, leading to the accumulation of elastic strain during the ‚Äústick‚Äù phase of stick-slip behavior. Just before 8:00 A.M. on December 26, 2004, the crust above a 1,300-km-long by 100-km-wide portion of
                        one of the faults in this subduction zone slipped and lurched westward by as much as 15 m. The rupture started at the focus and then propagated north at 2.8 km/s, so that the rupturing process, overall, took about 9 minutes. This
                        slip triggered a magnitude 9.3 earthquake‚Äîa great earthquake‚Äîand pushed the seafloor up by tens of centimeters <strong>(Fig. 10.32)</strong>. The rise of the seafloor, in turn, shoved up overlying ocean water. Because the area
                        that rose was so broad, it displaced an immense volume of seawater. As a consequence, tragedy of an unimaginable extent began to unfold. Gravity caused the water that had been pushed up to sink and then spread outward in a wave
                        moving at speeds of about 800 km/h‚Äîalmost the speed of a jet plane <strong>(Fig. 10.33).</strong></p>

This Japanese word translates literally as harbor wave, an apt name because tsunamis can be particularly damaging
                        to harbor towns. Though we most often hear of tsunamis generated by displacement due to an earthquake, they can also be triggered by submarine landslides (see Chapter 16) or by explosive eruption of island volcanoes (see Chapter
                        9). In older literature, tsunamis were called ‚Äútidal waves‚Äù because when one arrives on shore, as we will see, water rises as if a huge tide were coming in. But the waves have nothing to do with the Earth‚Äôs daily tidal cycles,
                        so the name is misleading. Though in popular media the word <em>tsunami</em> tends to be associated with giant or very high waves, in fact tsunamis come in all sizes‚Äîsome may be just centimeters high and are barely noticeable,
                        whereas others reach colossal heights, causing the sea surface to rise by as much as 30 m near the shore.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-801a-9598-c9fadd6da1f9" class="">Regardless of their cause, tsunamis differ greatly from familiar, wind-driven storm waves <strong>(Fig. 10.34)</strong>. Large wind-driven waves can reach heights of 10‚Äì30 m in the open ocean or as they crash on beaches. But even such
                        monsters have wavelengths (the distance between adjacent wave crests) of only tens of meters, so they contain a relatively small volume of water. In contrast, although a tsunami in deep water may cause a rise in the sea surface
                        of, at most, only a few tens of centimeters‚Äîa ship crossing one wouldn‚Äôt even notice it‚Äîtsunamis have wavelengths of tens to hundreds of kilometers, and an individual crest can be several kilometers wide, as measured perpendicular
                        to the wave front. Such waves contain an immense volume of water. In simpler terms, we can think of the width of a tsunami, in map view, as being more than 100 times the width of a wind-driven wave. Because of this difference,
                        a storm wave and a tsunami have very different effects when they strike the shore.</p>

                    id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80ad-92ed-db25a2d9ec8c" class="">When any wave approaches the shore, friction between the base of the wave and the seafloor slows the bottom of the wave, so the back of the wave catches up to the front, and the added volume of water builds the wave higher. The top
                        of the wave may fall over the front of the wave and produce a breaker. In the case of a wind-driven wave, the breaker may be tall when it crashes onto the beach, but because the wave doesn‚Äôt contain much water, it generally won‚Äôt
                        wash beyond the edge of the beach before it runs out of water. Friction slows the water running up the beach to a stop, and then gravity causes the water to recede back seaward. As is the case for a storm wave, when a tsunami approaches
                        the shore, friction slows it down, so water farther offshore catches up to the water near the shore. Consequently, even though a tsunami rises only centimeters in the deep ocean, a large one can build into a monster that can be
                        meters to tens of meters high near the shore. If a tsunami enters a bay or harbor that narrows landward, confinement of the water can build the wave even higher. In contrast to a storm wave, a single tsunami can have a crest many
                        kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers long. If you picture a storm wave as a narrow ridge, you can picture a tsunami as a broad plateau. As a result, a large tsunami contains so much water that it crosses the beach and just
                        keeps on going, eventually submerging all the low-lying land in a huge area. Notably, a single earthquake may generate several tsunamis that arrive on distant shores as much as an hour apart.</p>

                        class="">When the December 2004 wave struck Banda Aceh, a city at the north end of the island of Sumatra, the sea receded much farther than anyone had ever seen, exposing large areas of reefs that normally remained submerged even at low
                            tide. People walked out onto the exposed reefs in wonder, not realizing that such a severe pullback of water provides an important warning of an impending tsunami. Then, with a rumble that grew to a roar, a wall of frothing
                            water began to build in the distance and approach land <strong>(Fig. 10.35a)</strong>. Puzzled bathers first watched, then ran inland in panic when the threat became clear. As the tsunami approached shore, friction with the
                            seafloor had slowed it to less than 30 km/h, but it still moved faster than people could run <strong>(Fig. 10.35b)</strong>. In places, the wave front reached heights of 15‚Äì30 m as it slammed into Banda Aceh <strong>(Fig. 10.35c)</strong>.
                            The impact of the water ripped boats from their moorings, snapped trees, battered buildings into rubble, and tossed cars and trucks like toys. And the water just kept coming, eventually flooding low-lying land as far as about
                            7 km inland. It drenched forests and fields with salt-water (deadly to plants) and buried fields and streets in up to a meter of sand and mud. Eventually the water slowed and then began to rush back to the shore. At Banda Aceh,
                            at least two more tsunamis struck before the first one had entirely receded, so the water remained high for some time. The damage from the tsunamis at Banda Aceh was catastrophic <strong>(Fig. 10.35d)</strong>. When the water
                            level finally returned to normal, a jumble of flotsam, as well as the bodies of unfortunate victims, floated out to sea and drifted away.</p>

                                awareness. Because the T≈çhoku earthquake‚Äôs epicenter was 130 km offshore, ground shaking on land during the event was not extremely intense. But, since tsunamis travel so fast, the first waves reached the shore only about
                                10 minutes after the earthquake struck, and there was not much time for residents of coastal towns to escape when the warning sirens went off. The 10-m-high seawalls that fringe the coast were not high enough to stop the
                                advance of a wave that, in places, built to a height of 30 m when it reached shore. The rising sea picked up boats and ships in the harbor and flung them over the seawalls and, in some cases, onto the roofs of buildings.
                                It crossed the beach at a speed of 30 km/h, and once on land, it smashed through houses and tumbled cars as if they were pebbles. As the churning wave picked up dirt and debris, it became a viscous slurry resembling a volcanic
                                lahar, moving with such force that nothing could withstand its impact (see Fig. 10.2c). When the wave finally ran out of water, it receded to the sea, carrying debris and victims with it and leaving behind a wasteland <strong>(Fig. 10.38a)</strong>.</p>

                                        ground movements. In addition, many of the city‚Äôs neighborhoods perch on steep slopes, which slumped downhill during the quake. Sadly, buildings in Haiti were not designed to withstand ground shaking, and local
                                        emergency services were overwhelmed. The country did not have enough rescue workers, doctors, or supplies to cope with the catastrophe, and debris made streets impassable. To make things worse, the country has only
                                        a small airport, slowing down delivery of supplies by air, and the destruction of the port prevented ships from bringing relief. Continued poor sanitation contributed to the spread of cholera over the next 3 years.

Needless to say, many lives could be saved if we could determine which regions endure earthquakes more frequently so that building codes in these regions
                        could require stronger structures. Many more lives could be saved if we knew exactly when and where a specific earthquake would happen, so people could evacuate dangerous buildings and potentially unstable slopes. Even if we had
                        seconds to minutes of advance warning, it might provide enough time to shut off gas lines, electrical circuits, and water systems.</p>
                    <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8034-9909-d57757a93077" class="">Can seismologists predict the next great earthquake, the proverbial ‚Äúbig one?‚Äù The answer depends on the time frame of the prediction. With their present understanding of the distribution of seismic belts and the frequencies at which
                        earthquakes occur, seismologists can make <em>long-term predictions</em> (on a time scale of decades to centuries). For example, with some certainty, they can say that a major earthquake will probably rattle California during the
                        next 100 years and that a major earthquake probably won‚Äôt strike central Canada during the next 10 years. But despite extensive research, seismologists cannot make <em>short-term predictions</em> (on a time scale of hours to weeks
                        or even years). They cannot say, for example, that an earthquake will happen in Montreal next month. But new technologies may permit warnings to be sent seconds in advance of the arrival of seismic waves if an earthquake does happen.</p>

We also introduce earthquake early warning systems. Seismologists refer to studies leading
                        to predictions as seismic-risk assessment, or <em>seismic-hazard assessment</em>.</p>

For example, a seismologist may say, ‚ÄúThe probability of a major earthquake occurring in the next 20 years
                            in this state is 20%.‚Äù This sentence implies that there‚Äôs a one-in-five chance that an earthquake will happen during the 20-year period. Urban planners and civil engineers use long-term predictions to create building codes
                            for a region‚Äîcodes requiring stronger, more expensive buildings make sense for regions with greater seismic risk. Planners may also use predictions to determine whether to build vulnerable structures such as nuclear power plants,
                            hospitals, or dams in potentially seismic areas. Seismologists base long-term earthquake predictions on two kinds of information: the identification of seismic belts and the recurrence interval (the average time between successive
                            events) of earthquakes along a given fault.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80d5-ae4c-ec1ac72ed490" class="">To identify a seismic belt (or zone), seismologists produce a map showing the epicenters of earthquakes that have happened during a set period of time (say, 30 years). Clusters of epicenters define a seismic belt. The basic premise
                            of long-term earthquake prediction can be stated as follows: a region in which there have been many earthquakes in the past will probably experience more earthquakes in the future. Seismic belts, therefore, are regions of greater
                            seismic risk. This doesn‚Äôt mean that disastrous earthquakes can‚Äôt happen far from a seismic belt‚Äîthey can and do‚Äîbut the risk that an earthquake will happen in a given time window is less.</p>

                        class="">Seismologists can produce epicenter maps only with data from the past 60 years or so, because before that time they did not have enough seismograph stations to locate epicenters accurately. Fortunately, geologists can help provide
                            insight into seismic risk by examining landforms for evidence of recent faulting. For example, the presence of a distinct fault scarp in a landscape indicates that faulting has happened so recently that erosion has not yet
                            had time to grind away the evidence <strong>(Fig. 10.39a)</strong>. The offset of young topographic features, such as streams, also indicates relatively recent slip <strong>(Fig. 10.39b)</strong>. Notably, bends along strike-slip
                            faults can modify the land surface in distinctive ways. At restraining bends, compression takes place, causing uplift related to thrusting. At releasing bends, extension takes place, causing subsidence that produces a sag pond

This type of research, called <em>paleoseismology</em>, uses the historical
                            record to identify earthquakes that occurred during the past several centuries. To determine the ages of prehistoric earthquakes, they rely on geologic evidence. For example, a trench cut into sedimentary strata near a fault
                            may reveal layers of sand volcanoes and disrupted bedding in the stratigraphic record. Each such layer, whose age can be determined by using carbon-14 dating of plant fragments, records the time of an earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.40)</strong>.
                            By calculating the number of years between successive events and taking the average, seismologists obtain the recurrence interval. As an example, imagine that disrupted layers formed at 260, 820, 1,200, 2,100, and 2,300 years
                            ago. We can say that the recurrence interval between events is about 510 years. Note again that a recurrence interval does not specify the exact number of years between events, only the average number. Since stress builds up
                            over time on a fault, the probability that an earthquake will happen in a given year probably increases as time passes. Determining a recurrence interval allows seismologists to refine <em>seismic-hazard maps</em> representing
                            risk <strong>(Fig. 10.41)</strong>.</p>

Seismologists have explored a
                            number of possible clues to imminent earthquakes, but none have yet led to an accurate prediction, and often, possible clues can be recognized only in hindsight. For example, since rocks start to crack before a throughgoing
                            rupture forms and slips, recognition of a ‚Äúswarm‚Äù (a cluster of events during a short period) of foreshocks might be such a clue. But foreshocks do not always occur, and even if they do, they may be indistinguishable from other

                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-8013-9da7-e3ca9f0a11ec" class="">Similarly, since the crust deforms elastically prior to seismic slip (according to the elastic-rebound theory), and thus the local volume of rock may increase as open cracks start to develop, precise surveying of the ground (using
                            lasers or InSAR) may detect upwarping or downwarping of the land surface, which may hint at an upcoming earthquake. But again, such warping may be recognized only in hindsight. Recently, geologists have begun to use computer
                            models of stress to predict where stress buildups may lead to earthquakes, but these models have not yet proved to be a reliable predictor of events.</p>

                            faster than seismic waves, the signal arrives before the seismic waves. When the warning signal arrives, it activates electronic switches that automatically shut down gas pipelines, trains, nuclear reactors, power lines, and
                            other vulnerable infrastructure. The signal also automatically activates sirens and alerts broadcasters to send out warnings on radio, TV, and cell phone networks to the public. Unless the focus lies directly under the city,
                            the warning may precede the arrival of the first earthquake waves by several seconds‚Äînot a lot of time, but perhaps enough to prevent some infrastructure damage and to allow people to seek a safer location. Some earthquake-prone

                        the depth of the focus; the style of construction in the epicentral region; whether the earthquake occurred in a region of steep slopes or along the coast; whether building foundations are on solid bedrock or on weak substrate;

                        caused almost 500 times as many deaths as the latter (24,000 vs. 65). The difference in death toll primarily reflects differences in the style and quality of construction. The unreinforced concrete-slab buildings and masonry houses
                        of Armenia collapsed, whereas structures in California had, by and large, been erected according to building codes that take into account stresses caused by earthquakes. Most flexed and twisted but did not fall down and crush people.</p>

It killed over a quarter of a million people because the ground beneath the epicenter had been weakened
                        by coal mining and collapsed, and because buildings were poorly constructed. During the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in California, portions of Route 880 in Oakland that were built on a weak substrate collapsed, whereas portions built
                        on bedrock remained standing. Mexico City‚Äôs 1985 earthquake proved disastrous because the city lies over a sedimentary basin whose composition and bowl-like shape focused seismic energy, and because the vibrations had a frequency
                        that caused certain buildings to resonate <strong>(Box 10.2)</strong>. Because of the same problem, Mexico City‚Äôs 2017 earthquake also caused more damage than would have happened were the city not built on a basin.</p>

If you aim that beam at a prism, the light spreads into a spectrum of different colors, with each color representing light waves of a different frequency‚Äîthe original beam of
                            white light contained all those frequencies. Similarly, when an earthquake occurs, it produces seismic waves with a variety of frequencies. As the waves travel away from the focus, however, the Earth acts like a filter in that
                            high-frequency waves (waves with short wavelengths) lose energy more rapidly than low-frequency waves (waves with long wavelengths). You‚Äôve experienced this phenomenon if you‚Äôve ever heard a car stereo playing loud music‚Äîwhen
                            you stand near the car, you hear all the sound frequencies and can make out soprano voices and high-frequency guitar notes, but if you stand far away, all you can hear are the low-frequency thump-thump-thumps of the bass guitar
                            and bass drum. Because of this effect, the frequency content (the variety of wave frequencies) of an earthquake changes with distance from the focus.</p>

                            at just the right time to add more energy to a system. To understand resonance, picture a boy on a swing. If the boy pumps his legs at just the right time, he swings higher, but if not, he slows down. The same phenomenon occurs
                            if you slide a block of Jell-O that is resting on a plate back and forth on a table. If you move the plate too fast, the Jell-O merely trembles, but if you move at just the right frequency, resonance begins, and the block sways

The city was built on weak sedimentary strata deposited in a saucer-shaped basin.
                            Sudden fault slip within the convergent plate boundary along the Pacific Coast of Mexico generated a large earthquake, and seismic energy traveled a few hundred kilometers before reaching Mexico City. As the seismic energy
                            traveled, higher frequency waves were filtered out. The low-frequency waves that reached the city were amplified by passing through the weak sediment of the basin. These waves had just the right frequency to make the swaying
                            motion of buildings between 8 and 18 stories high begin to resonate. In some cases, neighboring buildings slam together like clapping hands. Engineers did not design the buildings to accommodate such motion, so many buildings
                            are susceptible to collapse. Between 8,000 and 30,000 people died, and another 250,000 were left homeless, when an earthquake struck Mexico City in 1985, and hundreds of lives were again lost as the city suffered another earthquake
                            in 2017.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-80ba-ab53-d64ce23ce115" class="">Communities can mitigate, or decrease, the consequences of earthquakes by taking sensible precautions. Clearly, <em>earthquake engineering</em> (designing buildings that can withstand shaking) and <em>earthquake zoning</em> (determining
                            where land is stable and restricting construction accordingly) can help save lives and property. In regions prone to large earthquakes, buildings and bridges should be constructed so that they are able to withstand vibrations
                            without collapsing <strong>(Fig. 10.43a, b)</strong>. They should be somewhat flexible so that ground motions cannot crack them, but they should have sufficient bracing so that movements don‚Äôt become too severe. In addition,
                            supports should be strong enough to maintain loads far in excess of their normal static (nonmoving) loads. Wrapping steel cables around bridge support columns makes them many times stronger. Bolting bridge spans to the tops
                            of their columns prevents the spans from bouncing off. Bolting buildings to foundations keeps them in place, and adding diagonal braces to frames keeps them from twisting and shearing too much. Earthquake-resistant construction
                            techniques have been improved greatly by testing scale models of designs on <em>shaking tables</em>, platforms that shake in response to computer-activated pistons.</p>

For example, concrete-block, unreinforced-concrete, and brick buildings crack and tumble under conditions in which wood-frame, steel-girder, and reinforced-concrete
                            buildings remain standing. Traditional heavy, brittle tile roofs shatter and bury the inhabitants inside, whereas sheet-metal or asphalt-shingle roofs do not. Loose decorative stone and huge open-span roofs also do not fare
                            well when shaken. Of note, inadequate structures can be made safer by <em>seismic retrofitting</em>, the process of strengthening existing buildings in potentially seismically hazardous areas. Examples of retrofitting include
                            adding shock absorbers to foundations, adding braces, jacketing support columns, and coating masonry with resins.</p>

They should not build on top of, on, or at the base of steep escarpments because the escarpments could
                            fail and produce landslides, and they should avoid locating large population centers downstream of dams, which could crack and collapse, causing a flood. And they should also avoid constructing vulnerable buildings directly
                            over active faults, because fault movement could crack and destroy the buildings. Cities in seismic zones need to draw up emergency plans to deal with disaster. Specifically, communication centers should be situated in safe
                            localities, and strategies need to be implemented for providing supplies under circumstances in which roads may be impassable.</p>

                            pressure gauges to determine whether a particular earthquake has generated a tsunami <strong>(Fig. 10.43c)</strong>. If observers detect a tsunami, they flash warnings to authorities in communities around the Pacific. Warning

Therefore, everyone needs to take personal responsibility for earthquake preparedness. As a starting
                            point, pay attention to maps that convey information about land stability. For example, you may wish to avoid living in a house or apartment that straddles a fault zone or sits on land that may be susceptible to landslides,
                            liquefaction, or inundation due to dam failure or tsunamis. Check with local officials and/or visit your town‚Äôs website to ensure that satisfactory emergency plans exist, that evacuation routes are clear, and that your region
                            has access to supplies for rescue and recovery.</p>
                        <p id="1e7971fe-bd2f-802a-8999-ee8ca566b8b4" class="">In your own home, you can proactively determine whether simple seismic retrofitting measures have been completed by asking: Is the building properly anchored to its foundation? Are floors properly anchored to support columns? Are
                            there diagonal support beams in walls? You should also take basic precautions, including bolting or strapping hot-water heaters, furnaces, and bookshelves to the walls, so that they don‚Äôt topple over; installing latches on
                            cabinets so they don‚Äôt pop open during shaking; and knowing how to shut off gas, water, and electricity.</p>

                                        steeply to the southwest. A rough correlation between maximum ground-surface displacement (<em>D</em>) and earthquake magnitude suggests that: if <em>D</em> = 0.5 m, <em>M</em>w = 6.5; if <em>D</em> = 1.0 m, <em>M</em>w
                                        = 7.0; if <em>D</em> = 4.0m, <em>M</em>w = 7.5; and if <em>D</em> = 6m, <em>M</em>w = 8.0. Based on this correlation, estimate the magnitude of the Hebgen Lake earthquake. (<em>Hint:</em> Assume the geologist is
                                        1.8 m tall.)</p>

Tilted layers of sedimentary strata form ridges. Some of the layers are so distinctive that they serve as ‚Äúmarkers‚Äù that allow an observer to measure fault
                                        displacement. Here, a vertical strike-slip fault underlies the major stream. Trace the fault, and trace a distinctive set of beds that you can see on both sides. How much displacement has taken place? Is the fault
                                        left-lateral or right-lateral? Why does the stream valley follow the fault trace?</p>
