                        office workers tapped at their computers, unaware that their surroundings were about to change forever. This coast lies near the convergent boundary at which the Pacific Plate slips beneath the edge of Japan and sinks back into
                        the mantle. Averaged over time, the relative movement across this boundary takes place at a rate of about 8 cm/y. But the motion doesn’t take place smoothly. Rather, for a while, rocks adjacent to the boundary quietly flex, like
                        a stick bent between your hands, to accommodate the motion, until suddenly, like a stick that snaps after you bend it too far, the rocks break, and a large amount of slip on a fracture takes place in a matter of seconds to minutes
                        <strong>(Fig. 10.1)</strong>. On March 11, at 2:46 P.M., such a “snap” started about 130 km east of Japan’s coast, at a depth of about 24 km below the seafloor. Japan lurched eastward by several meters, relative to the Pacific
                        Plate, and the seafloor moved upward by about 30 cm. The stage had been set for a disaster.</p>

                    <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-80ca-97f6-f52d803b5c95" class="">Geologists refer to a fracture on which such sliding takes place as a fault. The fault involved in the March 11 event delineates the boundary between Honshu and the Pacific Plate. The sudden breaking and sliding of rock along a fault
                        produces energy that propagates through the crust in the form of vibrations. In essence, these vibrations resemble the shock waves that travel through a breaking stick to your hands. In the Earth, vibrations can race through the
                        crust at an average speed of 11,000 km/h, 10 times the speed of sound in air. When the vibrations produced on March 11 reached Japan, the land surface lurched back and forth and bounced up and down for over a minute. People panicked,
                        became disoriented, and even seasick—some lost their balance and crouched or fell, and some heard a dull rumbling or thumping. Bottles and plates flew off shelves and crashed to the floor, buildings twisted and swayed, ceilings
                        and facades fell in a shower of debris, dust rose from the ground to create a fog-like mist, power lines stretched and sparked, and weaker buildings collapsed <strong>(Fig. 10.2a)</strong>. In addition, several natural gas tanks
                        and pipes broke, sending flammable vapors into the air—in some places, the gas ignited in billows of flame that set fire to damaged buildings. A major earthquake—an episode of ground shaking—had occurred. Geologists now refer to
                        this event as the Tōhoku earthquake, named for the northern province of Honshu.</p>

Building collapse and landslides
                        triggered by the May 12, 2008, earthquake in Sichuan, in central China, leveled cities—70,000 people died, and millions were left homeless. But in Japan, a country struck by earthquakes fairly frequently, officials have established
                        stringent building codes, which successfully prevented widespread building collapse in 2011. Unfortunately, even strong buildings could not resist what happened minutes after the earthquake shock. The sudden displacement of the
                        seafloor off Japan’s coast displaced a massive amount of ocean water and produced immense water waves known as <em>tsunamis</em>. When these waves washed over the land, they became a roaring jumble of water and debris that submerged
                        low-lying areas as far as 10 km from the shoreline <strong>(Fig. 10.2b, c)</strong>. In the end, the immensity of the devastation due to the Tōhoku earthquake was almost beyond comprehension.</p>

                        opening and closing of ocean basins. Fortunately, most cause no damage or casualties, either because they are too small or because they occur in unpopulated areas. But a few hundred earthquakes per year rattle the ground sufficiently
                        to crack or topple buildings and injure their occupants, and every 5 to 20 years, on average, a great earthquake triggers a horrific calamity. In fact, during the past two millennia, ground shaking, tsunamis, landslides, fires,
                        and other phenomena caused by earthquakes have killed over 3.5 million people <strong>(Table 10.1)</strong>.</p>

First, we define the point on a fault at which rock starts to rupture and slip as the <em>hypocenter</em>, or focus, of an earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.3a)</strong>.
                        Simplistically, we can picture the focus as the place inside the Earth from which earthquake energy, in the form of vibrations, begins to propagate. (In reality, the area of a fault that slips during an earthquake extends beyond
                        the focus, so not all of the energy produced during an earthquake actually originates right at the focus.) Second, we define the point on the surface of the Earth that lies directly above the focus as the earthquake’s epicenter.
                        We can portray the position of an epicenter as a spot on a map <strong>(Fig. 10.3b)</strong>.</p>

At first glance, a fault may simply appear to be a break that cuts across rock or sediment. But on closer examination, you may be able to see evidence of the sliding that occurred on a fault. For
                                example, the rock adjacent to the fault may be broken up into angular fragments, or may be pulverized into tiny grains, due to the crushing and grinding that can accompany slip. The surface of a fault may be polished and
                                grooved as if scratched by a rasp. In some localities, a fault cuts through a <em>marker</em>, such as a distinct sedimentary bed, an igneous dike, or a fence. Where this happens, the marker on one side of the fault no
                                longer lies adjacent to the marker on the other side after the fault slips. The distance between two ends of the marker, as measured along the fault surface in the direction of slip, is the fault’s displacement <strong>(Fig. 10.4)</strong>.</p>

                                    plane as the <em>footwall</em>, because it lay beneath their feet. These miners described the direction in which rock masses slipped on a sloping fault by specifying the direction in which the hanging wall moved relative
                                    to the footwall, and we still use their terminology today (<strong>Geology at a Glance</strong>, pp. 338–339). Specifically, a fault whose hanging wall has slipped down the slope of the fault is a <em>normal fault</em>,
                                    and a fault whose hanging wall has slipped up the slope is a <em>reverse fault</em> (if steep) or a <em>thrust fault</em> (if shallowly sloping). A <em>strike-slip fault</em> is a near-vertical fracture on which slip
                                    moves rock parallel to an imaginary horizontal line, called a <em>strike line</em>, on the fault plane. No upward or downward motion takes place on a strike-slip fault. Note that although we depict faults as single
                                    surfaces in Figure 10.5, in reality, major faults commonly consist of a zone including several smaller faults.</p>

For example, normal faults form in response to stretching or extension of the crust, whereas reverse faults and thrust faults
                                    develop in response to squeezing (compression) and shortening of the crust. Strike-slip faults form where one block of crust slides past another laterally.</p>

Faults that have slipped recently or are likely to slip in the near future are called <em>active faults</em>                                    (and if they generate earthquakes, news media sometimes refer to them as “earthquake faults”). Most active faults occur along plate boundaries or in currently developing collision zones and rifts. Faults that last slipped
                                    in the distant past and probably won’t move again for at least millennia are called <em>inactive faults</em>. Some faults have been inactive for billions of years and probably will never slip again.</p>

Apply an upward push on one of the clamps and a downward push on the other. By doing so, you have applied a stress to the rock—simplistically, we
                                can think of stress as a push, pull, or shear. At first, the rock bends slightly but doesn’t break <strong>(Fig. 10.6a)</strong>. In fact, if you were to stop applying stress before the rock broke, the rock would return
                                to its original shape. Geologists refer to such a phenomenon as elastic behavior—the same phenomenon happens when you stretch a spring and then let go. The change in shape due to elastic bending, stretching, or shortening
                                is called <em>elastic strain</em>. Now repeat the experiment, but bend the rock even more.</p>

                                occurs, the fracture has become a fault. Any elastic strain that had built up in the rock gets released, so the rock straightens out, or rebounds <strong>(Fig. 10.6c)</strong>. Such fault formation in a previously intact

Earthquakes can also happen by the sudden reactivation of sliding on pre-existing faults. In this case, stress builds up in rock until it’s sufficient to
                                overcome friction, either by breaking off asperities or by causing them to plow a groove into the opposing fault surface. The breaking or plowing of asperities causes the release of energy and, like the fracture of intact
                                rock, produces earthquakes. And, like a new fault, a <em>reactivated fault</em> can’t slip forever. Friction stops the motion and prevents the fault from slipping until stress builds up sufficiently again. Geologists refer
                                to such alternation between stress buildup and slip events as stick-slip behavior. You can model stick-slip behavior with a simple experiment. Attach a spring to a heavy block sitting on a rough table. By pulling on the
                                spring, you elastically stretch it and apply a stress to the block. The more you stretch the spring, the greater the stress. Suddenly the block slips, and when this happens, the spring relaxes, so the stress decreases.
                                You have to pull on the spring once again to increase stress enough to cause another sliding event <strong>(Fig. 10.7c)</strong>.</p>

When slip takes place, the
                                once-bent rocks adjacent to the fault rebound back to their original, unbent shape, thereby relieving the elastic strain. Geologists refer to this overall concept as the elastic-rebound theory of earthquake generation.
                                Notably, the stress necessary to reactivate a fault tends to be less than the stress necessary to break intact rock, so most earthquakes probably represent slip on pre-existing faults.</p>

These shocks possibly result from the development of the smaller cracks in the vicinity
                                of what will become the major fault surface. Smaller earthquakes, called aftershocks, follow a mainshock—the largest of these are 10 times smaller than the mainshock, and most are much smaller. Most aftershocks, especially
                                larger ones, take place soon after the mainshock. But they can occur sporadically for weeks or even years. Their distribution defines the overall area of the fault that slipped during the mainshock. Aftershocks of the Tōhoku
                                earthquake indicate that the fault slipped over an area 600 km long, as measured parallel to the coast, by 200 km wide, as measured perpendicular to the coast <strong>(Fig. 10.8)</strong>. Aftershocks happen because slip
                                during the mainshock does not leave the fault in a perfectly stable configuration. For example, after the mainshock, protrusions on one side of the fault surface, in their new position, may push into the opposing side and
                                generate new stresses. Such stresses may become large enough either to cause a small portion of the fault around the protrusion to slip again, or to trigger slip on a nearby fault.</p>

                                into the lithospheric mantle. In fact, such faults may be hundreds to thousands of kilometers long as measured on a map. For example, the San Andreas fault, a transform boundary, extends from the Earth’s surface to the

                                in up to 7 m of strike-slip displacement. During the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in southern Alaska, slip on a thrust fault marking the boundary between the Pacific Plate and North America reached a maximum of 12 m. Slip

The smallest perceptible

For example, if earthquakes occurring on a strike-slip fault
                                cause 1 cm of displacement per year, on average, the fault’s movement will yield 10 km of displacement after 1 million years. Thus, earthquakes mark the incremental movements that create mountains.</p>

In contrast, when a material changes shape by flowing slowly, while remaining solid, we say that it has undergone
                                <em>plastic deformation</em>. To picture the contrast between these two types of behavior, consider what happens if you try to bend a wax candle that has been kept in a freezer, compared with what happens if you try to
                                bend a candle that has been softened (but not melted) by placing it in a slightly warm oven. The frozen candle snaps, whereas the softened candle bends. Generation of energy in most earthquakes involves brittle deformation
                                of rock, for if rock flows plastically, it can accommodate movements without causing earthquakes.</p>

Because the temperature of continental crust increases with depth, continental crustal rocks typically become plastic
                                at depths below 15–20 km. As a result, earthquakes on faults in continental crust occur mostly in the upper 15–20 km. If a fault extends below that depth, slip on that fault still takes place, but the movement occurs plastically
                                without generating earthquakes. In crust (or lithospheric mantle) that has been subducted, earthquakes can happen at much deeper positions because cooler rock can be carried down to greater depth, as we’ll see later in
                                this chapter.</p>

When movement
                                on a fault happens without generating earthquakes, we call the movement fault creep. Seismologists do not completely understand fault creep, but speculate that it occurs in particularly weak rock or when the fault surface
                                has a coating of soft clay.</p>

The focus of an earthquake is the point in the Earth where the slip begins, and the epicenter
                                is the point on the surface of the Earth directly above the focus. Faults display stick-slip behavior in that stress builds until slip takes place. Then, stress builds again. Elastic rebound of rock when slip takes place
                                generates earthquake energy. The sizes of faults and the amount of displacement during faulting vary greatly.</p>

As we’ve noted, earthquake energy moves through rock and sediment in the form of vibrations. We call these
                        movements <strong>seismic waves, or </strong><em><strong>earthquake waves</strong></em>. You feel such waves when you hold one end of a brick and strike the other end with a hammer.</p>

Body waves pass through the interior of the Earth, whereas surface waves travel along the Earth’s surface. Waves that cause
                        particles of material to move back and forth parallel to the direction in which the wave itself moves are called compressional waves. As a compressional wave passes, the material first compresses (or squeezes together) and then
                        dilates (or expands). To see this kind of motion in action, push on the end of a spring and watch as the little pulse, in which the coils become more closely spaced, moves along the length of the spring. Waves that cause particles
                        of material to move back and forth perpendicular to the direction in which the wave itself moves are called shear waves. To see shear-wave motion, jerk the end of a rope up and down and watch how the undulation travels along the
                        rope.</p>

In fact, even if people near the
                        epicenter are thrown off their feet by a large earthquake, those 200 km away barely feel it. Similarly, an earthquake caused by slip on a fault deep in the crust causes less damage than one caused by slip on a fault near the surface.</p>

A seismograph consists of two components: an instrument, called
                                a <em>seismo-meter</em>, that detects shaking, and a device that records the data produced by the seismometer over time. Seismologists use two basic configurations of seismographs, one for measuring vertical (up-and-down)
                                ground motion and the other for measuring horizontal (back-and-forth) ground motion.</p>
                            <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-803a-8a91-d1824f6deec6" class="">

The spring connects to a sturdy frame that has been bolted to the ground.
                                A pen extends sideways from the weight and touches a vertical revolving cylinder of paper (the recording device) that has been connected to the seismometer frame. If the ground is steady, the pen traces out a straight reference
                                line as the cylinder revolves. But when a seismic wave arrives and causes the ground surface to move up and down, it makes the seismometer frame and the attached paper cylinder move up and down as well. The weight, however,
                                because of its <em>inertia</em> (the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest), remains fixed in space. As the revolving paper roll moves up and down with respect to the fixed pen, the line traced by the pen on the
                                paper deflects from the reference line. The deflection of the pen, therefore, represents the up-and-down movement of the ground. Note that if the paper cylinder did not revolve, the pen would simply move back and forth
                                in the same place on the paper, but since the paper moves under the pen, the pen traces out curves that represent seismic waves. A mechanical horizontal-motion seismograph works on the same principle, except that the paper
                                cylinder is horizontal and the weight hangs from a wire <strong>(Fig. 10.11b)</strong>. Sideways back-and-forth movement of the ground causes the pen to trace out seismic waves.</p>

This signal is recorded digitally <strong>(Fig. 10.11c)</strong>.
                                Such seismometers are so sensitive that they can record ground movements of a millionth of a millimeter (only 2 to 10 times the diameter of an atom)—movements that people can’t feel. This allows the instruments to measure
                                large earthquakes happening on the other side of the planet. Typically, therefore, seismologists place these instruments in vaults below the ground surface, away from traffic, trains, and swaying trees that together can
                                produce “noise,” or non-earthquake vibrations <strong>(Fig. 10.12)</strong>. The entire configuration constitutes a <em>seismograph station</em>.</p>

At first glance, a typical seismogram looks like a messy squiggle of lines, but to a seismologist
                                it contains a wealth of information. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents the <em>amplitude</em> (the size) of the seismic waves. The instant at which a seismic wave appears at a seismograph
                                station defines the <em>arrival time</em> of the wave. The first squiggles on the record represent P-waves because P-waves travel the fastest. Next come the S-waves, and finally the surface waves (R-waves and L-waves).
                                Typically, the surface waves have the largest amplitude and arrive over a relatively long interval of time.</p>

This way, all seismograms
                                use exactly the same time scale, so it’s possible to compare seismograms from different parts of the world and look for variations in arrival time and amplitude, quantities that depend on the distance between the seismograph
                                station and the epicenter, and on the size of the earthquake. Today, seismologists can obtain data from thousands of stations constituting the <em>worldwide seismic network</em>. Governments have supported this network
                                because in addition to recording natural earthquakes, it can also detect nuclear-bomb tests, so seismic records can allow governments to verify compliance with nuclear test-ban treaties.</p>

We begin by measuring the difference between the P-wave arrival time and the S-wave arrival time at seismograph stations. P-waves and S-waves pass through the interior of the
                        Earth at different velocities, so the difference between P-wave and S-wave arrival times increases as the distance from the epicenter increases <strong>(Fig. 10.14a)</strong>. To picture why, imagine a car race. If one car travels
                        faster than another, the distance between the two cars increases as the race proceeds.</p>

                        the travel-time curve for an S-wave differs from that for a P-wave. The gap between the two curves (as measured along a vertical line) represents the time delay between the P-wave arrival and the S-wave arrival.</p>

                        P time). Then draw a line segment on a piece of tracing paper to represent this amount of time, at the scale used for the vertical axis of the graph. Orient the line segment parallel to the vertical time axis and move it back and
                        forth until one end lies on the P-wave curve and the other end lies on the S-wave curve (this gives the S – P time). You have now identified the gap between the two travel-time curves for your seismograph station. Extend the line
                        down to the horizontal distance axis, and simply read off the distance to the epicenter.</p>

To determine the map position of the epicenter,
                        we <em>triangulate</em>, meaning we plot the distance from the epicenter to three stations. For example, imagine that you determine that the epicenter lies 2,000 km from Station 1, 4,000 km from Station 2, and 6,000 km from Station
                        3. On a map, you can draw a circle around each station such that the radius of the circle represents the distance between the station and the epicenter, at the scale of the map. The epicenter lies at the intersection of the three
                        circles, for this is the only point at which the epicenter has the appropriate measured distance from all three stations <strong>(Fig. 10.14c)</strong>.</p>

Seismologists have developed two scales to define “size” in a meaningful way so that they can systematically
                        describe and compare earthquakes. The first scale, called the Mercalli Intensity Scale, depends on human perception of ground shaking and the damage resulting from it at a given locality. The second scale, called the magnitude
                        scale, focuses on the measured amount of ground motion, as recorded by a seismograph at a specificed distance from the epicenter.</p>

In 1902, an Italian scientist named Giuseppe Mercalli devised a scale for defining intensity
                                by systematically assessing human perception of shaking and of the damage that an earthquake caused. A version of this scale, called the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, continues to be used today <strong>(Table 10.2)</strong>.
                                The MMI scale uses roman numerals ranging from I (low intensity) to XII (extremely high intensity). To use the scale, seismologists visit the affected region to interview residents and observe the damage. For example, if
                                an earthquake at a location causes everyone to notice shaking but does not damage buildings, then the earthquake had an intensity of III at that location. In contrast, if ground shaking feels significant and destroys poorly
                                constructed buildings, but causes only minor damage to substantial buildings, then the earthquake had an intensity of VIII.</p>

Furthermore, the MMI number varies with location for a particular
                                seismic event—we cannot assign a single MMI number to a given earthquake. Typically, the intensity decreases progressively away from the epicenter. To illustrate how intensity varies over a region for a particular earthquake,
                                seismologists draw lines, called contours, which delimit zones where the earthquake had a given intensity (<strong>Fig. 10.15</strong>). Generally, seismologists refer to the area within the intensity II contour line as
                                the <em>felt area</em>. Of note, not only is the maximum intensity of a “large” earthquake greater than that of a “small” one, but the distance from the epicenter to a given contour tends to be greater for a larger earthquake
                                than for a smaller one. In detail, the spacing between intensity contours for a given earthquake depends on the strength of the crust in the region where the earthquake occurred. In regions underlain by strong crust, the
                                crust can transmit earthquake energy more efficiently, so the contours lie father apart. In contrast, in regions underlain by weak crust (where the crust contains lots of fractures and/or consists of soft rock), the contours
                                lie closer together, so the earthquake affects a smaller area.</p>

                                mean? The magnitude of an earthquake indicates the maximum amplitude of ground motion recorded by a seismograph at a specific, standard distance from the focus. By “amplitude of ground motion,” we mean the amount of up-and-down
                                or back-and-forth motion of the ground. The larger the ground motion, the greater the deflection of a seismometer pen tracing out a seismogram. Because the magnitude does not depend on distance, use of the magnitude scale
                                allows seismologists to define the size of an earthquake objectively.</p>

The scale he proposed, in 1935, came to be known as the Richter scale. It indicates the maximum amplitude of motion
                                as it would be recorded at a seismograph station 100 km from the epicenter. Because the amount of deflection on a seismogram depends on the distance between the seismograph and the epicenter, and since most seismograph
                                stations do not happen to lie exactly 100 km from the epicenter, seismologists use a chart to adjust for distance of the station from the epicenter when calculating magnitude <strong>(Fig. 10.16)</strong>.</p>

                                not just the Richter scale, because the original Richter scale works well only for earthquakes whose focus lies close to the Earth’s surface and whose epicenter lies fairly close to the seismograph station. Because of the
                                distance limitation, seismologists now refer to a number on the original Richter scale as a <em><strong>local magnitude</strong></em><strong> (</strong><em><strong>M</strong></em><strong>L)</strong>.</p>

                                actually are. Because of this problem, seismologists developed the moment magnitude scale (<em>M</em>W), which provides the most accurate representation of an earthquake’s size. To calculate the moment magnitude, seismologists
                                take into account the amplitude of several different seismic waves, the dimensions of the slipped area on the fault, and the amount of displacement that occurred. The largest recorded earthquake in history, the great 1960
                                Chilean quake, registered as an 8.5 on the <em>M</em>L scale, but as a 9.5 on the <em>M</em>W scale. The larger number makes more sense because this earthquake was indeed much larger than other known events for which <em>M</em>L
                                = 8.5. Of note, the catastrophic 2011 Tōhoku earthquake had a magnitude of <em>M</em>W = 9.0.</p>

For early reports, seismologists report a preliminary magnitude, typically an <em>M</em>L, which can be calculated quickly. Later on, after they have had the chance
                                to collect the necessary data, seismologists report an <em>M</em>W, which becomes the number that appears in archival records.

Therefore, an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake results in ground motion that is
                                10 times greater than that of an <em>M</em>W 7 earthquake, and 1,000 times greater than that of an <em>M</em>W 5 earthquake. To make discussion easier, seismologists use familiar adjectives to describe the size of an earthquake,
                                as listed in <strong>Table 10.3</strong>. Note that we can roughly correlate magnitude with the intensity at the epicenter for earthquakes that take place in the upper continental crust.</p>

Seismologists have compared the energy released by earthquakes with that released by other events. According to some estimates, an <em>M</em>W 5.3 earthquake releases about
                                as much energy as the Hiroshima atomic bomb, and an <em>M</em>W 9 earthquake releases significantly more energy than the largest hydrogen bomb ever detonated, and even more than the explosive eruption of Krakatau (see Box
                                9.1). Notably, an increase in magnitude by one integer represents approximately a 32-fold increase in energy. Therefore, an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake releases about 1 million times more energy than an <em>M</em>W 4 earthquake
                                <strong>(Fig. 10.17a)</strong>. In fact, a single <em>M</em>W 8.9 earthquake releases as much energy as the entire average global annual release of seismic energy coming from all other earthquakes combined! Fortunately,
                                such large earthquakes occur much less frequently than small earthquakes. About 100,000 <em>M</em>W 3 earthquakes happen every year, but an <em>M</em>W 8 earthquake happens only about once or twice a year <strong>(Fig. 10.17b)</strong>.</p>

                        Most seismic belts coincide with plate boundaries, so we can refer to earthquakes within these belts as <em>plate-boundary earthquakes</em>. Earthquakes that happen away from plate boundaries are called <em>intraplate earthquakes</em>;
                        the prefix <em>intra-</em> means within <strong>(Fig. 10.18)</strong>. Eighty percent of the earthquake energy released on the Earth comes from the plate-boundary earthquakes in the seismic belts surrounding the Pacific Ocean.</p>

                                            have foci at depths of less than 25 km, so we classify them as shallow earthquakes. Since most ridges lie out in the ocean, far away from settled areas, mid-ocean ridge earthquakes don’t cause damage. Only a

The majority of transform faults in the world link
                                    segments of mid-ocean ridges, as we’ve just discussed. But a few, such as the San Andreas fault of California, the Alpine fault of New Zealand, and the Anatolian fault in Turkey, cut across continental lithosphere.
                                    All transform-fault earthquakes have a shallow focus, so the larger ones on land can cause immense damage.</p>
                                <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-80e6-a2f1-e14e961c3ff8" class="">The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 serves as an example of a continental transform-fault earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.20a)</strong>. In the wake of the gold rush, San Francisco was a booming city with broad streets and
                                    numerous large buildings. But it was built on the transform boundary along which the Pacific Plate moves north at an average rate of 6 cm/y relative to North America. Because of the stick-slip behavior of the fault,
                                    this movement tends to happen in sudden jerks, each of which causes an earthquake. At 5:12 A.M. on April 18, the fault near San Francisco slipped by as much as 7 m, and minutes later seismic waves struck the city. Witnesses
                                    watched in horror as the streets undulated, buildings swayed and banged together, laundry lines stretched and snapped, and weaker buildings collapsed. Fire followed soon after, consuming huge areas of the city <strong>(Fig. 10.20b)</strong>.
                                    Judging from the damage, seismologists estimate that the earthquake had an <em>M</em>W of 7.9.</p>

Specifically, as the downgoing plate begins to subduct,
                                    it bends and scrapes along the base of the overriding plate. Large thrust faults define the contact between the downgoing and overriding plates, and shear on these faults can produce disastrous, shallow earthquakes.
                                    Thrust faults in the accretionary prism may also slip. Bending causes normal faults to develop in the downgoing plate, seaward of the trench. In some cases, shear between the downgoing plate and the overriding plate
                                    also triggers shallow faulting in the overriding plate within and on both sides of the volcanic arc.</p>

                                    trigger large tsunamis. In each case, an area a few hundred kilometers wide (as measured perpendicular to the trench) and several hundred to 1,200 km long (as measured parallel to the trench) slipped. All convergent

                                    in response to stresses caused partly by shear between the downgoing plate and the mantle and partly by the pull of the sinking, deeper part of the plate on the shallower part.</p>

Shouldn’t the rock of a subducted plate at these depths be too warm and soft to break brittlely? To answer these questions, seismologists have studied
                                    the rate at which a subducting slab warms up as it sinks down through hot asthenosphere. They determined that because rock serves as an insulator, the interior of a downgoing plate actually remains cool enough to fracture
                                    seismically down to a depth of about 300 km. To explain deeper earthquakes, seismologists have studied the stability of minerals in the lithosphere. They found that at the extreme pressures developed in deeply subducted
                                    lithosphere, certain minerals (such as olivine) collapse to form new, denser minerals (spinel, at a depth of 410 km, and perovskite, at a depth of 660 km; see Fig. 10.21a). As such sudden phase changes (see Chapter
                                    8) take place, the minerals abruptly decrease in volume, perhaps along a fault-like band. This process could generate an earthquake, but the exact process by which this occurs remains the subject of research. Some of
                                    a subducted plate may accumulate at 660 km, whereas some sinks still deeper. But at depths greater than 660 km, processes that generate earthquakes in a subducted plate can no longer take place.</p>

                                    slip on the <em>Cascadia subduction zone</em> in 1700. Researchers worry that, during the next century, a similar event might take place along the <em>Cascadia convergent margin</em> (the coast of northern California,
                                    Oregon, and Washington, where the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath North America). An earthquake of similar size today would be disastrous to the region. GPS measurements have detected movement of the crust of the
                                    region, indicating the buildup of stress <strong>(Fig. 10.22)</strong>.</p>

Most seismologists favor the idea that stress applied to continental lithosphere triggers slip on pre-existing faults in the crust. Many of these faults may have first formed during Precambrian rifting
                        events and represent long-lived weak “scars” in the crust. The source of the stress driving fault reactivation remains controversial. Some seismologists attribute the stress to the push acting on plate boundaries, whereas others
                        suggest that it comes from the shear between the lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere, or even from the unloading that happens when glaciers on the surface melt.</p>

In North America, for example, intraplate earthquakes occur in the vicinities of New Madrid, Missouri; Charleston,
                        South Carolina; eastern Tennessee; Montreal, Quebec; and the Adirondack Mountains in New York. An <em>M</em>W 7.3 earthquake occurred near Charleston in 1886, ringing church bells up and down the coast and vibrating buildings as
                        far away as Chicago. In Charleston itself, over 90% of the buildings were damaged, and 60 people died. In 2011, an <em>M</em>W 5.9 earthquake rattled central Virginia, abruptly reminding residents of the eastern United States that
                        the region is not immune to seismicity. The tremor was felt from the Carolinas to New England, and people evacuated buildings in Washington, D.C., where some damage occurred to the Washington Monument and other structures.</p>

At the time, the region was inhabited by a small
                            population of Native Americans and an even smaller population of European descent. During the winter of 1811–1812, three <em>M</em>W 7–7.4 earthquakes struck the region. The ground motion temporarily reversed the flow of the
                            Mississippi River and toppled cabins <strong>(Fig. 10.25a)</strong>. The earthquakes resulted from slip on thrust and strike-slip faults that underlie the Mississippi Valley <strong>(Fig. 10.25b)</strong>. St. Louis, Missouri,
                            and Memphis, Tennessee, lie close to the epicenter, so if large earthquakes were to happen in the New Madrid region again, they could cause significant damage.</p>

                    <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-80a7-ae24-ffdf6e0d7103" class="">Most earthquakes reflect geologic phenomena independent of human activity. But the timing of some earthquakes relative to human-caused events suggests that in certain cases, people can indeed influence seismicity. Induced seismicity,
                        meaning seismic activity caused by actions of people, generally occurs in response to changes in groundwater pressure. Simplistically, the pressure of groundwater can push apart the opposing surfaces of faults slightly and, by
                        doing so, effectively decrease the friction that resists slip on those faults. So when people increase groundwater pressure by pumping lots of water underground in a region containing an active fault, the fault may slip under regional
                        stress conditions that might not have otherwise led to slip. Seismologists observed such a relationship near Denver, Colorado, when engineers pumped wastewater from a military installation down a deep well—as soon as the pumping
                        began, small earthquakes started in the region. A similar phenomenon has happened in Oklahoma, where seismicity increased markedly after 2009. The observed “earthquake swarm” lies near high-volume disposal wells into which wastewater
                        coming from oil and gas wells has been injected (see Chapter 14).</p>

                    <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-808e-b8e4-ffd6f9fcbcc2" class="">Induced seismicity can also become a danger where people build dams and create large reservoirs in valleys over-lying active faults. Faulting generally breaks up rock, making it more erodible by rivers, so it’s no surprise that deep
                        river valleys form over large faults. When a reservoir fills the valley above a fault, water seeps down into the fault and, under the pressure caused by the water column above, might trigger earthquakes.</p>

It didn’t take long
                        for seismic waves from the <em>M</em>W 8.5–9.0 earthquake to reach Lisbon, 440 km to the northeast. Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, was one of the great port cities and cultural centers of the day. The resulting ground shaking
                        toppled 85% of the city’s buildings, and fires set by overturned stoves then consumed much of the wreckage. Forty minutes later, a tsunami inundated the coast and washed away Lisbon’s harbor. In the end, more than 50,000 people
                        lost their lives. Also, the library, which housed all the records of Portuguese exploration as well as countless Renaissance artworks, was destroyed. The event led philosophers such as Voltaire (1694–1778) to question the long-held
                        belief that “this was the best of all possible worlds,” and to suggest that bad things happen by chance, so that making a better world requires human effort. This concept set the stage for the Age of Enlightenment.</p>

Its duration depends both on how long it took for slip on the earthquake-generating fault
                                to take place, and on the distance between the focus and the surface location. The distance to the focus matters because different types of seismic waves travel at different velocities, so the difference between their arrival
                                times increases as distance increases.</p>

                                weaker substrates; and (4) the frequency of the earthquake waves (where <em>frequency</em> equals the number of oscillations that pass a point in a specified interval of time)—high-frequency vibrations are not as dangerous

For example, P-waves are almost perpendicular to the ground surface when they arrive and cause the ground to buck up
                                and down. S-waves also reach the surface at a steep angle, but these waves are more complicated and tend to cause back-and-forth motion parallel to the ground surface. L-waves, the first surface waves to arrive, cause a
                                snake-like side-to-side undulation. R-waves, the last waves to arrive, result in a rolling motion as particles near the surface of the ground follow elliptical paths, in cross section. Interference among the different kinds
                                of waves causes motion to be anything but regular. In great earthquakes, the ground’s movement can have an amplitude of as much as 1 m at the epicenter, but in moderate earthquakes, motions fall in the range of a few centimeters
                                or less. Ground accelerations caused by moderate earthquakes lie in the range of 10%–20% of <em>g</em> (where <em>g</em> represents the acceleration due to gravity), and during a great earthquake, accelerations may approach
                                1 <em>g,</em> so ground movements can toss you into the air.</p>

Buildings and bridges aren’t so lucky <strong>(Fig. 10.27)</strong>. When earthquake waves pass, they
                                sway, twist back and forth, or lurch up and down, depending on the type of wave motion. As a result, connectors between the frame and facade of a building may separate, so that the facade crashes to the ground. The flexing

Aftershocks worsen the problem because they may topple already weakened buildings, trapping rescuers.
                                During earthquakes, roads, rail lines, and pipelines may also buckle and rupture.</p>

The water’s rhythmic movement, known as a <em>seiche</em>, can build up waves almost
                                10 m high and can last for hours. Seiches capsize small boats and flood shoreline homes. And if they occur in reservoirs, seiches may wash over and weaken retaining dams.</p>

This movement results in a <em>landslide</em>, the tumbling and flow of soil and rock downslope (see Chapter 16).
                                Seismically triggered landslides occur all too frequently along the coast of California, for movement on faults has rapidly uplifted this coastline in the past few million years, resulting in the development of steep cliffs.
                                When earthquakes take place, the cliffs collapse, often carrying expensive homes down to the beach below <strong>(Fig. 10.28a, b)</strong>. Such events lead to the misperception that “California will someday fall into the
                                sea.” Although small portions of the coastline do collapse, the state as a whole remains firmly attached to the continent, despite what Hollywood scriptwriters say.</p>

Liquefaction in beds of wet sand or silt happens because ground shaking causes the sediment grains to try to settle together. But because water fills the spaces (pores)
                                between grains, water pressure in the pores increases and pushes the grains apart, and the wet silt or sand becomes a slurry called <em>quicksand</em>. As the material above the liquefied sediment settles downward, pressure
                                squeezes the sand upward and out onto the ground surface—the result being sand volcanoes, as we’ve seen. The settling of sedimentary layers down into a liquefied layer can also disrupt bedding and can lead to formation
                                of open fissures of the land surface <strong>(Fig. 10.29d, e)</strong>.</p>

Contractors had built the neighborhood on a small terrace of uplifted sediment. A 20-m-high escarpment that
                                dropped down to Cook Inlet, a bay of the Pacific Ocean, formed the edge of the terrace. Here, as the ground shaking began, a layer of wet clay beneath the neighborhood liquefied. In this case, liquefaction allowed the overlying
                                terrace, along with the houses built on top of it, to slide seaward. In the process, the terrace broke into separate blocks that tilted, turning the landscape into a chaotic jumble <strong>(Fig. 10.30)</strong>. In wet
                                clay, the clay flakes stick together because there is surface tension in the water between the flakes, caused by the attraction of the water molecules to one another. When still, wet clay can behave like a solid gel, but
                                when shaken, the weak bonds between water molecules break, and the clay transforms into a viscous liquid. Clay that displays this behavior is called thixotropic clay, or <em>quick clay</em>.</p>

                                Tokyo in September 1923, fires set by cooking stoves spread quickly through the wood-and-paper buildings, creating an inferno that heated the air above the city. The hot air rose like a balloon, and when cool air rushed

Along this convergent boundary, the Indian Ocean floor subducts
                                at a rate of about 4 cm per year, leading to the accumulation of elastic strain during the “stick” phase of stick-slip behavior. Just before 8:00 A.M. on December 26, 2004, the crust above a 1,300-km-long by 100-km-wide
                                portion of one of the faults in this subduction zone slipped and lurched westward by as much as 15 m. The rupture started at the focus and then propagated north at 2.8 km/s, so that the rupturing process, overall, took
                                about 9 minutes. This slip triggered a magnitude 9.3 earthquake—a great earthquake—and pushed the seafloor up by tens of centimeters <strong>(Fig. 10.32) </strong>. The rise of the seafloor, in turn, shoved up overlying
                                ocean water. Because the area that rose was so broad, it displaced an immense volume of seawater. As a consequence, tragedy of an unimaginable extent began to unfold. Gravity caused the water that had been pushed up to
                                sink and then spread outward in a wave moving at speeds of about 800 km/h—almost the speed of a jet plane <strong>(Fig. 10.33).</strong></p>

This Japanese word translates literally as harbor wave, an apt name because tsunamis can be particularly
                                damaging to harbor towns. Though we most often hear of tsunamis generated by displacement due to an earthquake, they can also be triggered by submarine landslides (see Chapter 16) or by explosive eruption of island volcanoes
                                (see Chapter 9). In older literature, tsunamis were called “tidal waves” because when one arrives on shore, as we will see, water rises as if a huge tide were coming in. But the waves have nothing to do with the Earth’s
                                daily tidal cycles, so the name is misleading. Though in popular media the word <em>tsunami</em> tends to be associated with giant or very high waves, in fact tsunamis come in all sizes—some may be just centimeters high
                                and are barely noticeable, whereas others reach colossal heights, causing the sea surface to rise by as much as 30 m near the shore.</p>

Large wind-driven waves can reach heights of 10–30 m in the open ocean or as they crash on beaches. But
                                even such monsters have wavelengths (the distance between adjacent wave crests) of only tens of meters, so they contain a relatively small volume of water. In contrast, although a tsunami in deep water may cause a rise
                                in the sea surface of, at most, only a few tens of centimeters—a ship crossing one wouldn’t even notice it—tsunamis have wavelengths of tens to hundreds of kilometers, and an individual crest can be several kilometers wide,
                                as measured perpendicular to the wave front. Such waves contain an immense volume of water. In simpler terms, we can think of the width of a tsunami, in map view, as being more than 100 times the width of a wind-driven
                                wave. Because of this difference, a storm wave and a tsunami have very different effects when they strike the shore.</p>

                            <p id="1d6971fe-bd2f-807c-bc6c-e466bdc7ced3" class="">When any wave approaches the shore, friction between the base of the wave and the seafloor slows the bottom of the wave, so the back of the wave catches up to the front, and the added volume of water builds the wave higher.
                                The top of the wave may fall over the front of the wave and produce a breaker. In the case of a wind-driven wave, the breaker may be tall when it crashes onto the beach, but because the wave doesn’t contain much water,
                                it generally won’t wash beyond the edge of the beach before it runs out of water. Friction slows the water running up the beach to a stop, and then gravity causes the water to recede back seaward. As is the case for a storm
                                wave, when a tsunami approaches the shore, friction slows it down, so water farther offshore catches up to the water near the shore. Consequently, even though a tsunami rises only centimeters in the deep ocean, a large
                                one can build into a monster that can be meters to tens of meters high near the shore. If a tsunami enters a bay or harbor that narrows landward, confinement of the water can build the wave even higher. In contrast to a
                                storm wave, a single tsunami can have a crest many kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers long. If you picture a storm wave as a narrow ridge, you can picture a tsunami as a broad plateau. As a result, a large tsunami
                                contains so much water that it crosses the beach and just keeps on going, eventually submerging all the low-lying land in a huge area. Notably, a single earthquake may generate several tsunamis that arrive on distant shores
                                as much as an hour apart.</p>

                                low tide. People walked out onto the exposed reefs in wonder, not realizing that such a severe pullback of water provides an important warning of an impending tsunami. Then, with a rumble that grew to a roar, a wall of
                                frothing water began to build in the distance and approach land <strong>(Fig. 10.35a)</strong>. Puzzled bathers first watched, then ran inland in panic when the threat became clear. As the tsunami approached shore, friction
                                with the seafloor had slowed it to less than 30 km/h, but it still moved faster than people could run <strong>(Fig. 10.35b)</strong>. In places, the wave front reached heights of 15–30 m as it slammed into Banda Aceh <strong>(Fig. 10.35c)</strong>.
                                The impact of the water ripped boats from their moorings, snapped trees, battered buildings into rubble, and tossed cars and trucks like toys. And the water just kept coming, eventually flooding low-lying land as far as
                                about 7 km inland. It drenched forests and fields with salt-water (deadly to plants) and buried fields and streets in up to a meter of sand and mud. Eventually the water slowed and then began to rush back to the shore.
                                At Banda Aceh, at least two more tsunamis struck before the first one had entirely receded, so the water remained high for some time. The damage from the tsunamis at Banda Aceh was catastrophic <strong>(Fig. 10.35d)</strong>.
                                When the water level finally returned to normal, a jumble of flotsam, as well as the bodies of unfortunate victims, floated out to sea and drifted away.</p>

                                awareness. Because the Tōhoku earthquake’s epicenter was 130 km offshore, ground shaking on land during the event was not extremely intense. But, since tsunamis travel so fast, the first waves reached the shore only about
                                10 minutes after the earthquake struck, and there was not much time for residents of coastal towns to escape when the warning sirens went off. The 10-m-high seawalls that fringe the coast were not high enough to stop the
                                advance of a wave that, in places, built to a height of 30 m when it reached shore. The rising sea picked up boats and ships in the harbor and flung them over the seawalls and, in some cases, onto the roofs of buildings.
                                It crossed the beach at a speed of 30 km/h, and once on land, it smashed through houses and tumbled cars as if they were pebbles. As the churning wave picked up dirt and debris, it became a viscous slurry resembling a volcanic
                                lahar, moving with such force that nothing could withstand its impact (see Fig. 10.2c). When the wave finally ran out of water, it receded to the sea, carrying debris and victims with it and leaving behind a wasteland <strong>(Fig. 10.38a)</strong>.</p>

                                                in a country of 9 million, lost their homes.</p>

Haiti sits astride the transform boundary along which the North American Plate moves westward at about 2 cm/y, relative to the Caribbean Plate. So earthquakes in Haiti are inevitable.
                                                Slip-accommodating plate motion in Haiti happens along a few large faults; the southernmost of these was responsible for the disaster. The last major earthquakes on this plate boundary happened about 240
                                                years ago, so stress had been building on the fault for quite some time.</p>

                                                in the affected area. Much of Port-au-Prince was built on a basin of weak sediment, so as earthquake waves passed into this basin from regions of harder bedrock, they were amplified and therefore caused
                                                particularly large ground movements. In addition, many of the city’s neighborhoods perch on steep slopes, which slumped downhill during the quake. Sadly, buildings in Haiti were not designed to withstand
                                                ground shaking, and local emergency services were overwhelmed. The country did not have enough rescue workers, doctors, or supplies to cope with the catastrophe, and debris made streets impassable. To make
                                                things worse, the country has only a small airport, slowing down delivery of supplies by air, and the destruction of the port prevented ships from bringing relief. Continued poor sanitation contributed to
                                                the spread of cholera over the next 3 years. The country will take many years to recover.</p>

An <em>M</em>W 7.2 event in 2021, striking about 50 km west of the 2010 epicenter, caused the deaths of over 2,200
                                                people and the destruction of over 140,000 buildings. Because nothing can stop the movement of plates, the safety of the region’s inhabitants will depend on the strength of the new buildings that rise from
                                                the rubble and on efforts to reinforce buildings in other regions along the fault.</p>

With their present understanding of the distribution of seismic belts and the frequencies at which
                        earthquakes occur, seismologists can make <em>long-term predictions</em> (on a time scale of decades to centuries). For example, with some certainty, they can say that a major earthquake will probably rattle California during the
                        next 100 years and that a major earthquake probably won’t strike central Canada during the next 10 years. But despite extensive research, seismologists cannot make <em>short-term predictions</em> (on a time scale of hours to weeks
                        or even years). They cannot say, for example, that an earthquake will happen in Montreal next month. But new technologies may permit warnings to be sent seconds in advance of the arrival of seismic waves if an earthquake does happen.</p>

For example, a seismologist may say, “The probability of a major earthquake occurring in the next
                                    20 years in this state is 20%.” This sentence implies that there’s a one-in-five chance that an earthquake will happen during the 20-year period. Urban planners and civil engineers use long-term predictions to create
                                    building codes for a region—codes requiring stronger, more expensive buildings make sense for regions with greater seismic risk. Planners may also use predictions to determine whether to build vulnerable structures
                                    such as nuclear power plants, hospitals, or dams in potentially seismic areas. Seismologists base long-term earthquake predictions on two kinds of information: the identification of seismic belts and the recurrence
                                    interval (the average time between successive events) of earthquakes along a given fault.</p>

Clusters of epicenters define a seismic belt. The basic
                                    premise of long-term earthquake prediction can be stated as follows: a region in which there have been many earthquakes in the past will probably experience more earthquakes in the future. Seismic belts, therefore,
                                    are regions of greater seismic risk. This doesn’t mean that disastrous earthquakes can’t happen far from a seismic belt—they can and do—but the risk that an earthquake will happen in a given time window is less.</p>

Fortunately, geologists can
                                        help provide insight into seismic risk by examining landforms for evidence of recent faulting. For example, the presence of a distinct fault scarp in a landscape indicates that faulting has happened so recently
                                        that erosion has not yet had time to grind away the evidence <strong>(Fig. 10.39a)</strong>. The offset of young topographic features, such as streams, also indicates relatively recent slip <strong>(Fig. 10.39b)</strong>.
                                        Notably, bends along strike-slip faults can modify the land surface in distinctive ways. At restraining bends, compression takes place, causing uplift related to thrusting. At releasing bends, extension takes place,
                                        causing subsidence that produces a sag pond <strong>(Fig. 10.39c)</strong>.</p>

This type of research, called <em>paleoseismology</em>, uses
                                        the historical record to identify earthquakes that occurred during the past several centuries. To determine the ages of prehistoric earthquakes, they rely on geologic evidence. For example, a trench cut into sedimentary
                                        strata near a fault may reveal layers of sand volcanoes and disrupted bedding in the stratigraphic record. Each such layer, whose age can be determined by using carbon-14 dating of plant fragments, records the time
                                        of an earthquake <strong>(Fig. 10.40)</strong>. By calculating the number of years between successive events and taking the average, seismologists obtain the recurrence interval. As an example, imagine that disrupted
                                        layers formed at 260, 820, 1,200, 2,100, and 2,300 years ago. We can say that the recurrence interval between events is about 510 years. Note again that a recurrence interval does not specify the exact number of
                                        years between events, only the average number. Since stress builds up over time on a fault, the probability that an earthquake will happen in a given year probably increases as time passes. Determining a recurrence
                                        interval allows seismologists to refine <em>seismic-hazard maps</em> representing risk <strong>(Fig. 10.41)</strong>.</p>

                                        has been the site of numerous earthquakes in historic time. Since 1939, 11 major earthquakes have occurred along the fault—each rupturing a different portion of the fault <strong>(Fig. 10.42b)</strong>. By mapping
                                        the extent of the area that slipped during each earthquake, seismologists recognized a general westward progression in the faulting and therefore predicted that the next major earthquake on the North Anatolian fault

Seismologists have explored
                                    a number of possible clues to imminent earthquakes, but none have yet led to an accurate prediction, and often, possible clues can be recognized only in hindsight. For example, since rocks start to crack before a throughgoing
                                    rupture forms and slips, recognition of a “swarm” (a cluster of events during a short period) of foreshocks might be such a clue. But foreshocks do not always occur, and even if they do, they may be indistinguishable

                                    (using lasers or InSAR) may detect upwarping or downwarping of the land surface, which may hint at an upcoming earthquake. But again, such warping may be recognized only in hindsight. Recently, geologists have begun
                                    to use computer models of stress to predict where stress buildups may lead to earthquakes, but these models have not yet proved to be a reliable predictor of events.</p>

The instant that multiple seismograph stations detect the earthquake, a computer approximates
                                    the epicenter location and then sends a signal to a control center, which automatically sends out emergency signals to areas that might be affected. Since broadcast warning signals travel at the speed of light, orders
                                    of magnitude faster than seismic waves, the signal arrives before the seismic waves. When the warning signal arrives, it activates electronic switches that automatically shut down gas pipelines, trains, nuclear reactors,
                                    power lines, and other vulnerable infrastructure. The signal also automatically activates sirens and alerts broadcasters to send out warnings on radio, TV, and cell phone networks to the public. Unless the focus lies
                                    directly under the city, the warning may precede the arrival of the first earthquake waves by several seconds—not a lot of time, but perhaps enough to prevent some infrastructure damage and to allow people to seek a
                                    safer location. Some earthquake-prone regions, such as Japan and California, have already installed earthquake warning systems.</p>

                        the depth of the focus; the style of construction in the epicentral region; whether the earthquake occurred in a region of steep slopes or along the coast; whether building foundations are on solid bedrock or on weak substrate;

The 1988 earthquake in Armenia and the 1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California, each had a magnitude of between <em>M</em>W 6.6 and 6.8. But the former
                        caused almost 500 times as many deaths as the latter (24,000 vs. 65). The difference in death toll primarily reflects differences in the style and quality of construction. The unreinforced concrete-slab buildings and masonry houses
                        of Armenia collapsed, whereas structures in California had, by and large, been erected according to building codes that take into account stresses caused by earthquakes. Most flexed and twisted but did not fall down and crush people.</p>

It killed over a quarter of a million people because the ground beneath the epicenter had been weakened
                            by coal mining and collapsed, and because buildings were poorly constructed. During the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in California, portions of Route 880 in Oakland that were built on a weak substrate collapsed, whereas portions
                            built on bedrock remained standing. Mexico City’s 1985 earthquake proved disastrous because the city lies over a sedimentary basin whose composition and bowl-like shape focused seismic energy, and because the vibrations had
                            a frequency that caused certain buildings to resonate <strong>(Box 10.2)</strong>. Because of the same problem, Mexico City’s 2017 earthquake also caused more damage than would have happened were the city not built on a basin.</p>

If you aim that beam at a prism, the light spreads into a spectrum of different colors, with each color representing light waves of a different frequency—the original
                                        beam of white light contained all those frequencies. Similarly, when an earthquake occurs, it produces seismic waves with a variety of frequencies. As the waves travel away from the focus, however, the Earth acts
                                        like a filter in that high-frequency waves (waves with short wavelengths) lose energy more rapidly than low-frequency waves (waves with long wavelengths). You’ve experienced this phenomenon if you’ve ever heard

                                        low-frequency thump-thump-thumps of the bass guitar and bass drum. Because of this effect, the frequency content (the variety of wave frequencies) of an earthquake changes with distance from the focus.</p>

                                        wave arrives at just the right time to add more energy to a system. To understand resonance, picture a boy on a swing. If the boy pumps his legs at just the right time, he swings higher, but if not, he slows down.
                                        The same phenomenon occurs if you slide a block of Jell-O that is resting on a plate back and forth on a table. If you move the plate too fast, the Jell-O merely trembles, but if you move at just the right frequency,
                                        resonance begins, and the block sways wildly.</p>

The city was built on weak sedimentary strata deposited in a saucer-shaped
                                        basin. Sudden fault slip within the convergent plate boundary along the Pacific Coast of Mexico generated a large earthquake, and seismic energy traveled a few hundred kilometers before reaching Mexico City. As
                                        the seismic energy traveled, higher frequency waves were filtered out. The low-frequency waves that reached the city were amplified by passing through the weak sediment of the basin. These waves had just the right
                                        frequency to make the swaying motion of buildings between 8 and 18 stories high begin to resonate. In some cases, neighboring buildings slam together like clapping hands. Engineers did not design the buildings to
                                        accommodate such motion, so many buildings are susceptible to collapse. Between 8,000 and 30,000 people died, and another 250,000 were left homeless, when an earthquake struck Mexico City in 1985, and hundreds of
                                        lives were again lost as the city suffered another earthquake in 2017.</p>

Clearly, <em>earthquake engineering</em> (designing buildings that can withstand shaking) and <em>earthquake zoning</em>                                (determining where land is stable and restricting construction accordingly) can help save lives and property. In regions prone to large earthquakes, buildings and bridges should be constructed so that they are able to withstand
                                vibrations without collapsing <strong>(Fig. 10.43a, b)</strong>. They should be somewhat flexible so that ground motions cannot crack them, but they should have sufficient bracing so that movements don’t become too severe.
                                In addition, supports should be strong enough to maintain loads far in excess of their normal static (nonmoving) loads. Wrapping steel cables around bridge support columns makes them many times stronger. Bolting bridge
                                spans to the tops of their columns prevents the spans from bouncing off. Bolting buildings to foundations keeps them in place, and adding diagonal braces to frames keeps them from twisting and shearing too much. Earthquake-resistant

For example, concrete-block, unreinforced-concrete, and brick buildings crack and tumble under conditions in which wood-frame, steel-girder, and reinforced-concrete
                                buildings remain standing. Traditional heavy, brittle tile roofs shatter and bury the inhabitants inside, whereas sheet-metal or asphalt-shingle roofs do not. Loose decorative stone and huge open-span roofs also do not
                                fare well when shaken. Of note, inadequate structures can be made safer by <em>seismic retrofitting</em>, the process of strengthening existing buildings in potentially seismically hazardous areas. Examples of retrofitting
                                include adding shock absorbers to foundations, adding braces, jacketing support columns, and coating masonry with resins.</p>

They should not build on top of, on, or at the base of steep escarpments because the escarpments
                                could fail and produce landslides, and they should avoid locating large population centers downstream of dams, which could crack and collapse, causing a flood. And they should also avoid constructing vulnerable buildings
                                directly over active faults, because fault movement could crack and destroy the buildings. Cities in seismic zones need to draw up emergency plans to deal with disaster. Specifically, communication centers should be situated
                                in safe localities, and strategies need to be implemented for providing supplies under circumstances in which roads may be impassable.</p>

A tsunami warning center in Hawai`i keeps track of earthquakes around the Pacific and uses data relayed via buoys from tide gauges and
                                seafloor pressure gauges to determine whether a particular earthquake has generated a tsunami <strong>(Fig. 10.43c)</strong>. If observers detect a tsunami, they flash warnings to authorities in communities around the Pacific.
                                Warning signs posted along coasts direct people to safety on higher ground <strong>(Fig. 10.43d)</strong>. In recent years, planners have produced <em>tsunami warning maps</em>, which delineate coastal areas that should

Therefore, everyone needs to take personal responsibility for earthquake preparedness.
                                        As a starting point, pay attention to maps that convey information about land stability. For example, you may wish to avoid living in a house or apartment that straddles a fault zone or sits on land that may be
                                        susceptible to landslides, liquefaction, or inundation due to dam failure or tsunamis. Check with local officials and/or visit your town’s website to ensure that satisfactory emergency plans exist, that evacuation
                                        routes are clear, and that your region has access to supplies for rescue and recovery.</p>

Are floors properly anchored to support
                                        columns? Are there diagonal support beams in walls? You should also take basic precautions, including bolting or strapping hot-water heaters, furnaces, and bookshelves to the walls, so that they don’t topple over;
                                        installing latches on cabinets so they don’t pop open during shaking; and knowing how to shut off gas, water, and electricity.</p>

                                        a very sturdy piece of furniture that won’t get crushed if the ceiling falls, and that isn’t adjacent to glass windows <strong>(Fig. Bx10.3)</strong>. By taking these steps, you can reduce your chances of being
